# Appendix E: ERDA Book Toolbox

_**ERDA Book Toolbox**_

## E.1 Introduction

The ERDA Book Toolbox bundles reusable building blocks for structure, layout, interactivity, and reading experience in the ERDA book. It serves authors, editors, and co‑operation AIs as a toolkit to design new chapters consistently, reader‑friendly, and in the spirit of the ERDA vision.

## E.2 Overview of the Modules

The toolbox consists of the following core modules:

- **E.3 GitBook chapter template** – basic skeleton for new book chapters, including front matter, heading logic, and hint boxes.
- **E.4 Reader profile schema** – structure for target‑group profiles to systematically capture perspectives and needs.
- **E.5 Interactive elements (checklist and quiz)** – templates for reflection questions, checklists, and quiz formats to activate readers.
- **E.6 Box template (quotes, practice, contrasts, visions)** – design of highlighted boxes (e.g. best practices, contrastive scenarios, visions).
- **E.7 Template for a standardised ERDA reference list** – standardised structure for literature, web, and data sources in the ERDA style.
- **E.8 Role‑play template for quality assurance** – template for the multi‑stage role play used for content quality assurance.
- **E.9 Schema and prompt structure for co‑operation AIs** – technical and semantic guardrails for AI‑based collaboration in the project.

The following subsections provide a brief overview; the detailed templates can be found in the referenced files.

## E.3 GitBook Chapter Template

See `../content/anhang-e-erda-buch-baukasten/e.3-erda-gitbook-kapitel-template.md` in the German toolbox.

This template defines the basic structure of a chapter (title, introduction, numbered subsections, optional boxes) and ensures that new content integrates seamlessly into the overall book.

## E.4 Reader Profile Schema

See `../content/anhang-e-erda-buch-baukasten/e.4-erda-leserprofil-schema.md` in the German toolbox.

The schema helps to define clear reader profiles for each chapter (e.g. decision‑makers, expert audience, interested public) and to adapt the tone accordingly.

## E.5 Interactive Elements: Checklist and Quiz

See `../content/anhang-e-erda-buch-baukasten/e.5-interaktive-elemente-checkliste-and-quiz.md` in the German toolbox.

This module contains templates for reflection questions, checklists, and quiz formats that actively involve readers and deepen their understanding.

## E.6 Box Template: Quotes, Practice, Contrasts, Visions

See `../content/anhang-e-erda-buch-baukasten/e.6-boxen-template-zitate-praxis-kontraste-visionen.md` in the German toolbox.

Here, layout and text patterns for different types of boxes are described – for concise quotes, practice examples, contrasting scenarios, or visionary outlooks.

## E.7 Template for a Standardised ERDA Reference List

See `../content/anhang-e-erda-buch-baukasten/e.7-template-fur-ein-standardisiertes-erda-quellenverzeichnis.md` in the German toolbox.

The template defines a uniform structure for citations and references (including web, data, and primary sources) in line with the project’s standards for content and academic transparency.

## E.8 Role‑Play Template for Quality Assurance

See `../content/anhang-e-erda-buch-baukasten/e.8-rollenspiel-qualitatssicherungstemplate.md` in the German toolbox.

This module provides the framework for multi‑layered quality checks (e.g. reader profiles, critical ASI, "alien" meta‑perspective) as applied in Appendix K.

## E.9 Schema and Prompt Structure for Co‑operation AIs

See `../content/anhang-e-erda-buch-baukasten/e.9-schema-and-promptstruktur-fur-kooperations-kis-im-erda-projekt.md` in the German toolbox.

The schema describes how co‑operation AIs are integrated (roles, input/output formats, safety guardrails) so that they work consistently with the project’s licensing and quality principles.
