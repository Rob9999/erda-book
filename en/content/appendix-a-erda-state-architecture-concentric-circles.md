# Appendix A: ERDA State Architecture ("Concentric Circles")

_**ERDA State Architecture ("Concentric Circles")**_

The potential **ERDA states** (European Rights-Based Democratic Alliance) are structured according to their proximity, constitutional alignment and strategic role into three clearly defined categories.

***

### 1. 🔵 Core ERDA (Members with constitutional commitment)

**All ERDA core states must – by democratic decision – have adopted the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and ratified it as legally binding under international law.**  
The **Charter forms the legal core of ERDA** and is further developed – not replaced – by new ethical, technological and ecological dimensions.

Fully integrated member states with democratic constitutions and stable rule of law, ordered by population size (as of 1 January 2024) (see e.g. en.wikipedia.org, "List of European Union member states by population"):

| State       | ISO | Population |
| ----------- | --- | ---------- |
| Germany     | DE  | 83 445 000 |
| France      | FR  | 68 402 000 |
| Italy       | IT  | 58 989 700 |
| Spain       | ES  | 48 610 500 |
| Poland      | PL  | 36 621 000 |
| Romania     | RO  | 19 064 400 |
| Netherlands | NL  | 17 942 900 |
| Belgium     | BE  | 11 832 000 |
| Czechia     | CZ  | 10 900 600 |
| Portugal    | PT  | 10 639 700 |
| Sweden      | SE  | 10 551 700 |
| Greece      | GR  | 10 397 200 |
| Austria     | AT  | 9 158 800  |
| Bulgaria    | BG  | 6 445 500  |
| Denmark     | DK  | 5 961 200  |
| Finland     | FI  | 5 603 900  |
| Slovakia    | SK  | 5 424 700  |
| Ireland     | IE  | 5 343 800  |
| Croatia     | HR  | 3 862 000  |
| Lithuania   | LT  | 2 885 900  |
| Slovenia    | SI  | 2 123 900  |
| Latvia      | LV  | 1 871 900  |
| Estonia     | EE  | 1 374 700  |
| Luxembourg  | LU  | 672 100    |

**Total population of the 24 ERDA core states:** **438 125 100**.

### 2. 🟡 Extended partnership (associated democracies in Europe and neighbourhood)

Democracies with high compatibility with ERDA core countries and strategic importance that have full partnership capability without formal political integration.

#### **2.1 Stable democracies with immediate compatibility**

These countries already fulfil all ERDA standards, bring robust institutions and strong innovative capacity, and can be associated at the push of a button:

#### **2.2 Democracies with stable reform orientation and high proximity**

These states are on their way to full ERDA compatibility, are pursuing reforms in a targeted way and have clearly defined EU perspectives:
