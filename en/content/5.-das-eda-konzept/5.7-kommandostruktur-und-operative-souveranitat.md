# 5.7 Command structure and operational sovereignty

_**Command structure and operational sovereignty**_

* The EDA command structure consists exclusively of representatives of full member states to ensure coherence, accountability and democratic legitimacy.
* The **Integrated Joint Command** oversees strategic operations, troop deployments and the coordination of intelligence services.
* Establishment of a **Continental Early‑Warning and Air‑Defence Command** analogous to NORAD for Europe and the Arctic region.
* **Decentralised resilience** as a core principle: EDA forces are structured like a secure, autonomous network that remains functional even under partial isolation.
* At least **250,000 personnel** per **Defence Sovereignty Node (DSN)** within full member states form part of the **Persistent Deterrence Force (PDF)**, autonomously capable of action in the event of major disruptions or siege.
* Cyber Command, special forces and space capabilities remain decentralised but interoperable via secure EDA protocols.
* Massive build‑up of a **European Drone Force (EDF)** to complement manned units – for reconnaissance, logistics, precision strikes and swarm defence.
* Parliamentary and civilian oversight is exercised via the EDA Council and the ERDA Constitutional Assembly.
