# 5.5 Global coordination and responsibility

_**Global coordination and responsibility**_

* Not a NATO alternative, but a fully autonomous security pillar
* These alliances reflect a growing global consensus: the protection of democracy requires cooperation beyond regional borders
* Global coordination with democratic security alliances (e.g. emerging alliances such as ADO, ASDA, LDA, AFDA)
* Long‑term vision: creation of a **Global Defence Alliance (GDA)** of constitutional democracies
* Launch of a **Democracy Security Network** for values‑based cooperation
