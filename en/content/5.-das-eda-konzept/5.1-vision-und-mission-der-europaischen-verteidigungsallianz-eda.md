# 5.1 Vision and mission of the European Defence Alliance (EDA)

_**Vision and mission**_

The European Defence Alliance (EDA) is a values‑based defence architecture that unites European and allied democracies in a shared commitment to security, freedom and democratic sovereignty. It complements NATO while ensuring that Europe remains capable of defence and strategically autonomous, even in times of transatlantic uncertainty.

**Core objectives:**

* Protection of democracy, the rule of law and territorial integrity
* Strengthening Europe’s independent deterrence and defence capability
* Enabling rapid, coordinated responses to hybrid and conventional threats
* Involving global democracies in a flexible, values‑oriented security community
