# 5.10.1 Rationale and principles

_Rationale and principles_

* **Peace through strength:** nuclear deterrence is not an act of aggression, but a last protective measure against existential threats.
* **Democratic control:** all nuclear assets are subject to strict constitutional oversight, parliamentary approval and the requirement of democratic proportionality.
* **Complement, not duplication:** this capability complements NATO’s nuclear umbrella but provides an autonomous backbone in times of crisis.
