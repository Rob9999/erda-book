# 5.10 Nuclear deterrence and strategic autonomy

_**Strategic nuclear deterrence capability**_

**Safeguarding peace through democratic and proportionate deterrence**

To preserve strategic autonomy and protect the territorial integrity of democratic constitutional states in Europe, the EDA must be able to credibly deter even the most extreme threats. In view of global instability and potential uncertainties surrounding transatlantic guarantees, the EDA is to build a fully sovereign, legally bound nuclear‑deterrence capability.
