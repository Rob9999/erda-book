# 5.10.5 Public communication and ethical foundation

_**Public communication and ethical foundation**_

> _“We do not rely on unpredictability – we rely on responsibility. Europe’s democracies do not defend themselves out of fear, but out of a duty to peace and freedom.”_

The EDA’s nuclear deterrence is communicated as a **minimalist, rule‑of‑law‑bound, democratically anchored last resort** – an expression of European maturity, responsibility for peace and strategic prudence in a fragile world order.
