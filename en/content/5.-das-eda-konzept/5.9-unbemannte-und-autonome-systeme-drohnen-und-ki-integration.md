# 5.9 Unmanned strategic systems and drone forces

_**Unmanned strategic systems and drone forces**_

The European Defence Alliance (EDA) is establishing the **European Drone Force (EDF)** as a forward‑looking strategic component to significantly increase deterrence depth, operational capability and flexibility.

The EDF integrates powerful unmanned systems that can be deployed autonomously and in combination. It ensures that Europe can effectively meet the challenges of hybrid and conventional threats – technologically sovereign, democratically legitimised and ethically responsible.

***

## 5.9.1 Core components of the EDF

* **Swarm drones:** autonomous, AI‑controlled swarms for precise and scalable operational effects.
* **Autonomous reconnaissance platforms:** persistently operating systems for comprehensive situational awareness in all domains.
* **Loitering munitions:** intelligent "kamikaze" drones for pinpoint effects against critical targets.
* **Electronic‑warfare (EW) drones:** specialised systems for disrupting and neutralising adversary communications and sensor systems.
* **Logistics and supply drones:** unmanned systems for autonomous resupply of deployed forces, even under fire or in remote areas.
* **Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs):** autonomous systems for maritime reconnaissance, mine clearance and tactical effects.
* **Infantry and terrain drones:** combat‑capable unmanned systems (two‑, four‑, six‑, eight‑legged and wheeled) to accompany and reinforce infantry operations; equipped with laser weapons, kinetic projectiles, explosive munitions and guided micro‑rockets.
* **Orbital drones and platforms:** autonomous satellite systems for communications, reconnaissance and strategic deterrence in orbit.

## 5.9.2 Rules of Democratic Engagement Framework

All EDF systems are subject to clearly defined rule‑of‑law engagement rules that guarantee accountability, proportionality and democratic transparency. Decisions on operational measures are always taken with human confirmation and ethics‑AI integration in order to exclude normative misuse.

***

## 5.9.3 EDF organisation and networking

* **Distribution and operational integration:** EDF units are fully integrated into the Defence Sovereignty Nodes (DSNs), use secure battle networks and work closely with ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) and space systems.
* **Drone Innovation Task Force:** permanent research unit for developing and testing advanced swarm AI, quantum‑secure communication, human‑machine collaboration and civil‑military dual‑use technologies.

***

## 5.9.4 Strategic elasticity and reserve capacity

At least 25% of the EDF structure is held as an operational reserve so that unexpected crises and mission requirements can be met flexibly without endangering system integrity.

***

## 5.9.5 Forward‑looking strategic development

Inspiration from China’s successful military‑civil fusion strategy is used to expand Europe’s drone development in a technologically and economically sustainable way:

* **Dual‑use and co‑development:** targeted support for civil drone technologies with potential military application.
* **Platform economy and exportability:** development of a modular, cost‑efficient drone industry with civil and military applications.
* **Innovation network:** close networking of civil research institutions, universities, industry partners and military development units.

## 5.9.6 Democratic and ethical guidelines

The EDF combines technological efficiency with social responsibility. This takes place with the involvement of civil control mechanisms (CIVITAS modules), normative ethics codes and transparent governance. Human user feedback is continuously fed into AI development to ensure social inclusion and acceptance of the systems used.

> "Technological superiority – democratically accountable, ethically guided."

***

## 5.9.7 Assessment and outlook

The EDF is Europe’s answer to modern warfare: highly capable, ethically grounded, democratically legitimised. It thus ensures sustainable defence capability and Europe’s strategic independence.

> "Effective defence means not only technological superiority – but also ethical clarity and societal acceptance."
