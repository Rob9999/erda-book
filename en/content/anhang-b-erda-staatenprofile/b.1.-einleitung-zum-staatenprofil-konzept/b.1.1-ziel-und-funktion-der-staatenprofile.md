# B.1.1 Purpose and Function of the State Profiles

_**Purpose and function of the state profiles**_

The ERDA state profiles capture, in a systematic manner, the political, social, economic, technological, cultural and ecological potential and trajectories of participating and prospective member states. They are designed to

* **enable comparability** without enforcing uniformity,
* **identify strategic strengths** while also labelling weaknesses honestly,
* **model development pathways** that differentiate between status quo, best-case and worst-case scenarios,
* and clearly state the **role of each country within the ERDA Vision 2075**.
