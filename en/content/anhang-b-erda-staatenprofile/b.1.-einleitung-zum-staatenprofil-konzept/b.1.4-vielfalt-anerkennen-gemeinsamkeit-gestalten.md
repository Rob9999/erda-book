# B.1.4 Recognising Diversity – Shaping Common Ground

_**Recognising diversity – shaping commonality**_

The profiles strike a balance between individuality and integration. They do not prescribe what a state must be – they describe what it can contribute and how it might evolve. The profiles do not replace policy – they offer orientation. They do not replace constitutions – they respect them. They are not checklists – they are resonant spaces for a shared democratic future.

> _Democracy is not merely a status. It is a process. And ERDA is its collective compass._
