### 10. Snapshot: "Serbia at a glance"

Serbia is a dynamic country in the heart of the Balkans with deepening ties to Europe. Potential in renewables and a strategic location make it an important partner for the EU and ERDA. Challenges remain, including demographic decline and economic transformation. Bold reforms and open cooperation can turn Serbia into a stable pillar of democratic Europe by 2075.
