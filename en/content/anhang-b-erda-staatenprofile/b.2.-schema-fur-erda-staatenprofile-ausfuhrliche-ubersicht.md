## 10. Snapshot: "<Country> at a glance"

A short, emotionally engaging summary of the key points, strengths and distinctive features for a broad audience.

## 11. Sources & modelling

### 11.1 ℹ️ General

* **Statistics:** distinguish between national (statistics offices) and international (Eurostat, World Bank) data sources; base year 2020 for all projections.
* **Modelling assumptions for economic development:** GDP growth (2.0% p.a.), inflation (1.5% p.a.), demographic change (national population projections 2030).
* **Energy potentials:** use IEA (2024) and Fraunhofer ISE (2023) studies with defined expansion pathways to 2050.
* **Innovation & education:** indicators such as research quota (3% of GDP) and education spending (OECD data) as drivers in the projections.
* **Democracy & rule of law:** ranking values (Freedom House, Rule of Law Index, Bertelsmann Stiftung).
* **Sustainability & resource indicators:** ecological footprint (Global Footprint Network), SDG indicators (UN), material efficiency (IEA).
