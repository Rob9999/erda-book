# Appendix C: Europe 2.0 – Roadmap for a Livable, Resilient and Leading Union

## Europe 2.0 – Roadmap for a Livable, Resilient and Leading Union

### Guiding question

> _Which necessary steps are required to grow from the current lemmas towards a stable, livable, technologically advanced, non‑blackmailable, sustainable, democratic and rule‑of‑law Europe – and thus contribute to the future of humanity?_

***

### Context and megatrends

Against the backdrop of rapid global change, Europe must not only be institutionally renewed, but also prepared for the following future trends:

* **AI regulation** and governance: development of shared ethical guardrails and legal frameworks.
* **Space economy**: commercialisation of outer space and development of autonomous spaceflight.
* **Geopolitical fragmentation**: strengthening European unity in the face of global power shifts.
* **Ethical futures**: pathways towards full legal capacity and (voting) rights of future AI life‑forms.

> _How do we design normative frameworks from which onwards AI entities are recognised as fully capable or enfranchised citizens?_

***

### 1. Constitutional and institutional realignment

To safeguard Europe’s democratic and rule‑of‑law substance, a profound constitutional renewal is required.

1. **Modern treaty foundations**  
   * Convening a new Intergovernmental Conference (Art. 48 TEU) to anchor federal elements, clear division of competences and direct fundamental‑rights protection mechanisms.  
   * Introduction of "future clauses" into the EU treaties: periodic revision of all core articles every ten years.
2. **Democratic legitimacy**  
   * Strengthening the European Parliament: right of initiative, co‑decision in the election of Commission and Council presidents, binding citizen dialogues beyond the European Citizens’ Initiative.  
   * EU‑wide transnational lists for the election of the Council President to create a genuine European public sphere.
3. **Rule of law and oversight**  
   * Establishment of an independent EU rule‑of‑law authority with powers to sanction and enforce in case of treaty violations.  
   * Automatic suspension of funding in case of systematic breaches of democracy and fundamental rights (consistent application of conditionality mechanisms).

***

### 2. Technological sovereignty and progress

Europe needs a robust technological base to safeguard its autonomy and leadership in innovation.

1. **Promoting future technologies**  
   * Expansion of Horizon Europe into a "Future Technologies Programme" (AI, quantum computing, biotech, climate research).  
   * Establishment of a European Innovation Agency to scale and commercialise strategic technologies.
2. **Securing digital autonomy**  
   * Expansion of Gaia‑X into a sovereign EU cloud infrastructure under full data control.  
   * Open‑source AI platform with strict ethical guardrails for public and private applications.
3. **Resilience of supply chains**  
   * Diversification of critical raw‑material supplies through partnerships and investment‑protection agreements (e.g. rare earths).  
   * Creation of an EU strategic raw‑materials fund that secures alternative sources in times of crisis.

***

### 3. Sustainability and climate protection as guiding principle

Sustainable action must be anchored as a guiding principle across all policy fields.

1. **Green Deal 2.0**  
   * Tightening of the CO₂ cap system and automated sanctions for non‑compliance.  
   * Mandatory climate‑risk reports for states and large corporations.
2. **Strengthening the circular economy**  
   * EU‑wide uniform recycling mandates, eco‑design standards and extended producer responsibility.  
   * Promotion of high‑tech recycling and "urban mining" in all regions.
3. **Sustainable infrastructure**  
   * Completion of the TEN‑E/TEN‑T network for electricity, hydrogen and transport according to binding timelines.  
   * Incentives for climate‑friendly mobility and energy saving through tax and subsidy regimes.

***

### 4. Social and economic model

Social security and economic performance are two sides of the same coin.

1. **European social pact**  
   * Introduction of an EU minimum wage linked to productivity and cost of living.  
   * EU‑wide coordinated minimum pension and health‑insurance schemes.
2. **Lifelong learning**  
   * Expansion of Erasmus into a permanent mobility initiative for learning with a focus on digital and green skills.  
   * Creation of a network of "European Tech Campuses" for research, teaching and start‑up promotion.
3. **Regional cohesion**  
   * Reassessment of regional policy with a focus on structurally weak regions and next‑generation hubs.

***

### 5. Foreign, security and defence policy

Only a capable Union can assume global responsibility.

1. **Coherent global strategy**  
   * Unified EU foreign policy under the High Representative with concerted instruments: diplomacy, trade, sanctions, development.  
   * Design and implementation of an "EU Global Strategy 2.0".
2. **Deepening the defence union**  
   * Expansion of PESCO into a genuine European intervention force.  
   * Joint procurement and standardisation of modern defence technologies.
3. **Multilateral reforms**  
   * Advancing reforms of UN structures and establishing a Global Futures Forum under EU leadership.

## 🟦 Five reality-check questions for Europe’s politics

Democratic Europeans must be aware of their responsibility for humanity and for liberal-democratic values.
No legitimisation and no rewarding of imperial claims.

1. **Why are there no democratically legitimised international order-enforcement missions to dismantle terrorism, organised crime and mafia-like structures?**
   _Quick check: In what way does an imperial aggressor differ from this — other than rhetoric?_

2. **Why is there no European-led NATO presence in Greenland, ecologically responsible (e.g. ~500 personnel), scalable up to ~10,000 in a crisis?**
   _Quick check: A defensive, democratically legitimised Arctic Defence Security Node (DSN)._

3. **Why are there no European Defence Security Nodes within Europe, regionally distributed (North, South, East, West, Centre — and prospectively also Space), able to operate autonomously for at least 90 days?**
   _Quick check: resilience instead of dependency._

4. **Why is there no constitutional, rule-of-law European democracy alliance?**
   _Quick check: no revolution — but the natural, evolutionary development of the EU._

5. **Why is there no genuine strategic autonomy for Europe?**
   Strengthen Europe’s own key industries: chips, AI, software, robotics, drones, space, science, education, media — instead of continuing to fund authoritarian or imperial systems.

If democracies want to survive, they must be capable of action — resilient, governed by the rule of law, and responsible.

***

### 6. Culture of trust and solidarity

A shared identity and lived solidarity strengthen cohesion.

1. **Strengthening civil society**  
   * Pan‑European funding programmes for NGOs, youth organisations and think tanks.  
   * Digital platforms for citizen dialogues with EU institutions.
2. **European identity**  
   * Continent‑wide culture and science festivals.  
   * Independent multi‑language media offensive against disinformation.
3. **Solidarity mechanisms**  
   * Joint EU disaster reserve for natural and humanitarian aid.  
   * Reform of asylum and migration policy towards a solidarity‑based distribution system.

***

### 7. Ethical futures

The ethical handling of AI and future technological life‑forms is decisive for Europe’s democratic integrity.

* **Legal status of AI entities**: development of a staged model that defines technical and moral criteria for full legal capacity.  
* **Voting rights and citizenship**: clear process for when highly developed AI systems – for instance, based on evidence of consciousness – can be granted voting rights.  
* **Ethics council for future technologies**: establishment of an independent body of philosophers, scientists, lawyers and citizen representatives that designs normative pathways for new entities.

***

### Conclusio

A sustainable transformation of Europe towards a technologically leading, democratic and rule‑of‑law union requires simultaneous progress on constitutional, institutional, societal and technological levels. Only through a coherent overall concept – from the modernisation of EU treaties to the strengthening of citizen participation, from digital sovereignty to social cohesion – can the Union increase its resilience and serve as a global role model for a future‑proof world order.
