# 9. The SPACE Concept

_**The SPACE Concept**_\


### 📘 **Executive Summary for Decision-Makers**

***

🎯 **Aim of the Chapter**\
This chapter outlines a future-oriented, democratically legitimised space strategy that goes beyond technological innovation: it understands space activities as an expression of planetary responsibility, ethical maturation and global capacity for cooperation. Outer space is not seen as a geopolitical power vacuum, but as a realm of human existence that must be shaped legally, ecologically and civilisationally.

***

🧭 **Key Messages for Decision-Makers**

* **Outer space is a commons – not geopolitical property.**\
  Clear, democratically anchored cosmos governance prevents exclusive use by authoritarian actors and private corporations.
* **Democratic control of space activities and technology is a precondition for legitimacy.**\
  Security, sustainability and freedom in space can only be safeguarded through legally binding, multilateral agreements – embedded in an ethics that is globally comprehensible.
* **Europe’s leadership role lies in anticipating and embodying a civilisational code for outer space.**\
  The "Solar Alliance" is the institutional expression of this responsibility – it embodies interplanetary cooperation, legal binding force and civilisational solidarity.
* **Technology needs purpose.**\
  Space activities without an ethical foundation degenerate into instruments of power – with potentially irreversible consequences for the environment, society and peace.

🛠 **Concrete Policy Options**

1. **Institutionalise cosmos law:**
   * Develop a "Democratic Codex for Cosmic Responsibility" with binding norms (e.g. fairness in resource use, non-militarisation, interplanetary participation).
   * Establish a multilateral treaty framework under the leadership of ERDA.
2. **Create infrastructure and institutions:**
   * Build the _Sphere Stations_ (EARTH ONE, LUNAR ONE, etc.) as ethically reflected space-civilisation modules with research, education and societal architecture.
   * Establish a _Solar Parliament_ and a _Space Law Chamber_ for global conflict resolution.
3. **Establish a democratic space culture:**
   * Promote interplanetary education, cultures of remembrance, ethical discourse and cultural diversity in space.
   * Enable citizen participation in space projects via digital platforms (CIVITAS-compatible).
4. **Link with planetary justice:**
   * Connect space and climate policy (e.g. through climate observation systems, energy recycling in orbit).
   * Design resource policies tied back to human rights, Indigenous perspectives and intergenerational justice.

***

⚠️ **Risk Profile if No Action is Taken**

* **Militarised positions of dominance** (e.g. by authoritarian regimes or private corporations without democratic legitimacy).
* **Technological monopolisation** of key infrastructures (communication, navigation, energy).
* **Ecological devastation of orbital and planetary spheres** through unregulated resource exploitation, debris and radiation.
* **Loss of Europe’s cultural, ethical and legal interpretive authority** in a new geopolitical sphere.

***

🌍 **Visionary Benefits for Europe (Long-Term Perspective 2075+)**

* Europe becomes a _civilisational authority in space_, not through power but through measure:
  through democracy, transparency, justice and cultural depth.
* The _Solar Alliance_ becomes an _ethical ordering power for space_ – comparable to international law after 1945, but open to future generations, compatible with AI and applicable on an interplanetary scale.
* Space activities are no longer an elite project, but _a collective task of a humanity aware of its dignity_ – Europe’s contribution is the institutional framework and the ethical-philosophical foundation for this.

📎 **Concluding Impulse for Decision-Makers**

> Space policy is no longer merely technology policy – it is constitutional policy on the scale of humanity. Those who shape outer space today shape civilisation’s self-image. Europe’s opportunity lies in ethical leadership, not in an arms race.
