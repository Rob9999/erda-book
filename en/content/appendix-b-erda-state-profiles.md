# Appendix B: ERDA State Profiles

_**ERDA State Profiles – Concept and Schema**_

The European Rights-Based Democratic Alliance (ERDA) is not only a political or institutional project, but a civilisational future model. At its core is the ambition to anchor democracy, the rule of law, technological sovereignty and social justice in a globally networked yet fragile world order. The ERDA state profiles are a central analytical, communication and design instrument for this ambition.

They describe how individual states – inside and outside ERDA – contribute to a resilient democratic network up to 2050 and 2075. Each profile follows a common structure so that countries can be compared transparently and can be invited into ERDA cooperation on a fair and attractive basis.

## B.1 Introduction to the ERDA State Profile Concept

The ERDA state profile concept pursues several goals at once:

- **Strategic overview:** capture, in a compact and comparable way, where a country stands in terms of democracy, economy, technological capabilities, security and culture.
- **Long-term perspective:** make visible which development paths are plausible for 2050 and 2075 and which levers are crucial for a resilient, rights-based democracy.
- **Invitation and narrative:** formulate a positive, self-determined story for each country: how it can contribute to ERDA – and what the partnership makes possible for its citizens.

The profiles are not designed as ranking tools, but as **cooperative planning instruments**. They should support governments, parliaments, civil society and research to jointly design paths towards democratic resilience and post-scarcity prosperity.

## B.2 Schema for ERDA State Profiles (v5, extended overview)

Each ERDA state profile follows a standard schema (version 4, 2025). It starts with a short description block in the front matter and then structures the content into eleven to twelve thematic sections.

### B.2.1 Front matter

The profile begins with a metadata block, for example:

```markup
---
description: "State: {{country-code}}, Date: {{YYYY-MM-dd}}, Responsible Author: {{author}}, if from official or institute: Legal Responsible [Author, Institute, Government]: {{official}}"
country: "{{country-code}}"
date: "{{YYYY-MM-dd}}"
author: "{{author}}"
legal_responsible: "{{official}}"
layout: "ERDA-State-Profile-v5"
version: "1.0"
---
```

This clarifies who is responsible for the content, on which data basis it rests and which layout version is used.

### B.2.2 Main sections of the profile

In the body of the document, the following sections structure the analysis:

1. **Overview (Meta):** official name, geographical location, population, form of government, current constitutional situation, ERDA status and envisaged role in the ERDA network.
2. **Demographics & society:** population development, age structure, urbanisation, education, life expectancy, migration balance and indicators of social cohesion.
3. **Economy & innovation:** GDP, key industries, degree of automation and digitalisation, research and innovation quota, patents and participation in ERDA economic alliances (FORTERA, Democracy Trade Network, EHAM+).
   - **Infrastructure autonomy:** assessment of sovereignty in strategic sectors such as energy, IT/cloud, defence, food, satellite communication, quantum technology and autonomous logistics systems.
4. **Resource profile:** natural resources (land and sea area, strategic raw materials, renewable potentials, biodiversity), social resources (volunteering, participation, health system) and political resources (constitutional commitment, instruments of direct democracy, quality of democracy and rule of law).
5. **Security & strategic role (EDA):** military and civil security capacities, role in different regions (Arctic, Europe, Global/Solar Alliance), resilience programmes and high-tech capabilities.
   - **Arctic strategy & planetary responsibility:** optional for Arctic states, including integration into Arctic security and resilience frameworks and cooperation with indigenous communities.
6. **Cultural identity & soft power:** languages and indigenous cultures, UNESCO heritage, strength of the creative industries, international visibility and cultural role in democratic networks.
7. **Development path (2025–2075):** scenario development with status 2025 and best/base/worst-case trajectories for 2050 and 2075, including risks and proactive solution approaches.
8. **Narrative & attraction:** core message, examples of strong narratives, citizen participation, "future dignity" and the invitation that the profile formulates to other states and citizens.
9. **Key indicators (short form):** table with selected indicators (GDP, population, renewables share, life expectancy, education, AI capacity, civil society index) for 2025, 2050 and 2075, including EU benchmarks.
10. **Country at a glance:** concise, emotionally accessible summary of strengths, challenges and unique features for a broad audience.
11. **Sources & modelling:** explanation of data sources, assumptions and models (statistics, economic development, energy potentials, innovation and education, democracy and rule of law, sustainability indicators), including exemplary references.
12. **Participation and updates:** clear invitation to governments, institutes and civil society to contribute, update and correct the profile; indication of the last responsible author and date.

### B.2.3 Formatting and collaboration hints

To keep the profiles consistent and easy to maintain, the following conventions apply:

- Use standard Markdown link syntax (`[Title](URL)` for web sources, `[Title](./path-to-file.md)` for internal references).
- In running text, clickable links can be combined with footnote-style references (e.g. `[Title](URL)[1]`) that are then resolved in the sources section.
- Group references thematically (e.g. demography, economy, security) and follow the **DIN ISO 690:2013-10** citation standard.
- Clearly label hypothetical or modelled references with the note **"(hypothetical)"**.
- Profiles should be created preferably with or on behalf of the respective state; purely external profiles should be the exception and clearly marked.

## B.3–B.5 State profile collections

In the full German version, Appendix B also contains grouped collections of state profiles:

- **B.3 ERDA state profiles – EU core countries**
- **B.4 ERDA state profiles – EU extended partnership**
- **B.5 ERDA state profiles – global associated partners**

These collections host concrete profiles for individual countries based on the schema described above. For the English edition of the book, these may be added step by step as soon as validated translations or original English profiles are available.

Until then, this appendix primarily documents the **concept and schema** so that policymakers, researchers and civil society can already work with the framework and begin to develop profiles for their own countries.
