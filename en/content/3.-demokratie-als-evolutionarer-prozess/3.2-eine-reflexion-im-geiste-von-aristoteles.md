# 3.2 A reflection in the spirit of Aristotle

_**A reflection in the spirit of Aristotle**_

> _"For where the law does not rule, arbitrariness rules; and where arbitrariness rules, there is no commonwealth."_ – loosely based on Aristotle, _Politics_

### 3.2.1 Introduction and core impulses

Human beings are not only rational creatures. They are beings that seek meaning. In community they recognise themselves; in dialogue they grow beyond themselves. Aristotle called them _zoon politikon_ – political beings who do not live merely in order to survive, but in order to shape, to understand, to act. Yet this capacity does not arise from instinct, but from maturation.

In this sense, democracy is not a condition that is reached and then administered. It is a process – a continual becoming. It does not begin with a constitution, but with a question: What is a good life – for me, for us, for all?

The evolutionary character of democracy is shown in its ability to question itself without destroying itself. It allows change without losing its foundation: the dignity of the individual, the power of joint decision-making, and the binding to law rather than to the will of the stronger.

In a world ever more deeply interwoven with technology, democracy must not retreat – it must grow. It must learn to generate resonance in new spaces: between human and machine, between planet and cosmos, between I and we.

**Core impulses:**

- **Virtue as practice:** Democracy requires lived virtue, not just formal rules.
- **Measure and mean:** Political decisions succeed through balance between freedom and order.
- **Self-binding instead of external domination:** The rule of law is established through individual ethical responsibility.
- **Ongoing reflection:** Democracy is a continuous exercise in judgement.

### 3.2.2 Deep dive and analysis

| Aristotelian principle                 | Description                              | Democratic implementation                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Doctrine of the mean (mesotes)**     | Virtue lies in the middle between excesses | Balancing plurality and unity                 |
| **Practical reason (_phronēsis_)**     | Capacity for judgement built through experience | Participatory debate formats as a training ground |
| **Ethos of action**                    | Character shaped through repeated practice | Civic engagement as a virtuous habit          |
| **Orientation towards the common good** | Acting for the benefit of the polis      | Common-good commissions at all levels          |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Establish regular reflexive feedback rounds in parliamentary committees.
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Rule by arbitrariness ≠ binding to law – without virtue ethics, democratic rules lack a soul.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Formal procedures without ethical practice degenerate into empty rituals.
