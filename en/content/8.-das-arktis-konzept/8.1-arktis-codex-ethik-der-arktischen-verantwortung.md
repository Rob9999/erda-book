# 8.1 ARKTIS Codex – Ethics of Arctic Responsibility

_**ARKTIS Codex – Ethics of Arctic Responsibility**_

#### 1. Respect for nature and its limits

The Arctic represents a unique, fragile ecosystem whose protection has the highest priority. All activities must take place within clear ecological boundaries in order to avoid irreversible damage.

#### 2. Indigenous sovereignty and participation

The rights of indigenous and local populations, in particular the Inuit and other Arctic communities, are indispensable. Their active and equal participation in decision-making processes affecting their territories and livelihoods must be ensured.

#### 3. Sustainable use of resources

The extraction of natural resources may only take place using state-of-the-art, environmentally friendly technologies. Resource exploitation must, as a matter of principle, be designed in such a way that it guarantees ecological sustainability.

#### 4. Transparency and international cooperation

All scientific data, research findings and environmental studies must be published transparently and made internationally accessible. A cooperative approach with all Arctic nations and affected populations is mandatory.

#### 5. Peaceful use and freedom from conflict

The Arctic is and will remain a zone of peace. Any militarisation or military use is to be ruled out. Conflicts must be prevented in advance, and diplomatic solutions are always to be preferred.

#### 6. Fair distribution of resources and regional development

The use of Arctic resources must directly benefit the local population. Fair and equitable participation models are obligatory in order to secure regional development, education, healthcare provision and prosperity.

#### 7. Protection of cultural identities

The cultural diversity and identity of Arctic communities must be actively protected and promoted. Traditional ways of life and cultures must be respected and preserved.

#### 8. Application of the precautionary principle

In cases of scientific uncertainty regarding possible environmental damage or risks, the precautionary principle applies: the protection of the environment and people takes precedence over economic interests.

#### 9. Democratic decision-making

All decisions in the context of the Arctic are taken in a transparent manner and democratically legitimised. The involvement of civil society and relevant stakeholders via participation platforms must be systematically ensured.

#### 10. Education and responsibility

Promoting a comprehensive understanding of the ecological, cultural and social specificities of the Arctic is central. Education and awareness-raising should strengthen the sense of responsibility and sustainable action of all those involved.
