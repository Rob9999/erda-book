# 1.2 Economic Pressure and Global Systemic Competition

_**Economic Pressure and Global Systemic Competition**_

_“Between the waves of markets and the storms of politics, Europe must chart its own course._\
_The glance back provides roots, the look ahead an unobstructed view._\
_Onward to new shores where Europe reinvents itself and builds a future that brings prosperity and security._\
_Not through walls, not through capitulation – but through strength and bridges forged from reason and values._\
_Where technology is not merely competition but an active space for shaping the future, the new sovereignty begins.”_

### 1.2.1 Introduction: Europe’s Economic Tightrope Walk

Protectionism, trade conflicts, and potential US tariffs under a second Trump presidency are forcing Europe to redefine its economic resilience. Dependence on strategic imports – in areas such as semiconductors, energy, and digital infrastructure – has proven to be a structural weakness. The answer cannot, however, be isolation, but rather **values-based, intelligent sovereignty**.

**Core impulses:**

* Europe must pursue **technological autonomy** in key industries.
* Cooperation and diversification instead of **economic isolationism**.
* A combination of **value orientation** and **strategic competition**.

### 1.2.2 Deep Dive: Internal and External Competitive Levers

| Lever                    | Internal                                          | External                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Production sovereignty   | Insufficient domestic capacity in semiconductors  | Dependence on US/Asian supply chains                   |
| Energy supply            | High share of fossil imports                      | Global price spikes triggered by geopolitical crises   |
| Research & innovation    | Fragmented EU funding programmes                  | Competition from massive state investments (China)     |
| Regulation & standards   | Non-uniform regulations in member states          | Regulatory gaps in global trade                        |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse (France):** National chip plan with a €2 billion investment pool for semiconductor manufacturing.
>
> 🧠 **Concept contrast:** Autarky vs. strategic partnerships – without open technology cooperation, innovation stagnation looms.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Fragmented industrial policy can lead to competitive disadvantages and relocation of production sites.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** “Economic sovereignty is not about building walls but about building bridges into new technology alliances.”

### 1.2.3 Transformation: Strategic Options for Action

* **Diversification strategy:** Establish regional production clusters (e.g. Southern Europe for solar, North Sea for offshore wind).
* **Values-based investment:** EU impact fund to promote sustainable key technologies.
* **Integrated single market:** Harmonise standards and regulatory hurdles in the energy, IT, and defence portfolios.
* **R&D collaborations:** Joint EU research initiative for **quantum, next-generation batteries**, and the **green hydrogen economy**.
