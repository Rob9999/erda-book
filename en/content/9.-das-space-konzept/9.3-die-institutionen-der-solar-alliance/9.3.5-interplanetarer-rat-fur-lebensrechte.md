# 9.3.5 Interplanetary Council for Rights of Life

_**Interplanetary Council for Rights of Life**_

This council observes, evaluates and regulates questions of the dignity of life in space – not only with regard to human beings, but also to:

* biospheres (e.g. terraforming zones),
* sensitive ecological systems,
* possible non-human intelligences.

It works together with research institutions, philosophers, ethics committees and environmental monitoring bodies and issues recommendations to the Parliament and the Alliance Council.
