# 9.3.8 Democratic Solar Defense Force

_**Democratic Solar Defense Force**_

The Solar Alliance recognises that security in space cannot be guaranteed solely by passivity or technological abstinence. Rather, it requires an active, democratically controlled and ethically bound defensive structure – in the sense of deterrence through awareness, not aggression.

The **Democratic Solar Defense Force (DSDF)** follows these principles:

* **Preventive research**: development of technologies to be technically and legally prepared for conceivable threats – whether from physical objects, AI‑controlled systems or hypothetical external actors. This research is conducted **transparently**, under civilian control and subject to strict ethical standards.
* **Distributed defensive presence**: establishment of a network of decentralised defensive security units – in orbit, on the Moon and in the belt – focusing on reconnaissance, protection of civilian infrastructure and emergency response. **Bio‑technologically integrated systems** (such as humanoid drone units or AI‑controlled response teams) may be part of this structure, provided they are clearly bound to constitutional principles.
* **Symbolic communication**: the Solar Alliance does **not** wish to appear as a militarised species. Its defence doctrine is based on balance, not dominance, and on a signal to potential extraterrestrial observers: _"We are open, but not defenceless. We seek partnership, but we will defend life."_

This force is under the control of the SOLAR PARLIAMENT, is subject to continuous ethical review and may **not** be used for offensive operations or power projection.

> Defence in the spirit of ERDA is not reaction out of fear, but protection out of responsibility.
