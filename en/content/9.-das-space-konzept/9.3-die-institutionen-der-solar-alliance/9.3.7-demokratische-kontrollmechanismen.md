# 9.3.7 Democratic control mechanisms

_**Democratic control mechanisms**_

The Solar Alliance is built on participation. It establishes:

* **CIVITAS interfaces** for democratic participation,
* **public reporting obligations** for all bodies,
* **rotation requirements** in key offices,
* and **independent ethics councils** that reflect on long‑term impacts.

> Only through transparency and participation does order become legitimacy – and an alliance become a community.
