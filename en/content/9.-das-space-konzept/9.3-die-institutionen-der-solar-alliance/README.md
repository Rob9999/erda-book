# 9.3 The Institutions of the SOLAR ALLIANCE

_**The institutions of the SOLAR ALLIANCE**_

_The SOLAR ALLIANCE is more than a multilateral agreement. It is an institutionally legitimised order of democratic cooperation in space. Its institutions are intended to ensure that responsibility, sovereignty, the rule of law and sustainability do not remain vague principles, but are given concretely implementable structure. Like every rule-of-law-based order, it rests on the separation of powers, checks and balances, and participation._
