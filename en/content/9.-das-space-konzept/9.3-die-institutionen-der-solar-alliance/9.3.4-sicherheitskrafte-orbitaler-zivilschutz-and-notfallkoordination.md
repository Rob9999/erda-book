# 9.3.4 Security Forces: Orbital Civil Protection & Emergency Coordination

_**Security Forces: Orbital Civil Protection & Emergency Coordination**_

The security structure of the SOLAR ALLIANCE follows the principle: _civil security before military dominance_. Its tasks include:

* protection against collisions, system failures and space debris,
* evacuations and first aid in the event of accidents,
* de-escalation in political tension zones in orbit.

There is no offensive armament – the security modules are defensive, de-escalating and humanitarian in nature.
