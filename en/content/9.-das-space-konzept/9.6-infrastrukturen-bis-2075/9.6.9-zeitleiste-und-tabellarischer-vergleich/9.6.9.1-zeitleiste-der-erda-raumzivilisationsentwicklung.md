# 9.6.9.1 Timeline of ERDA’s space‑civilisation development

_**Timeline of ERDA’s space‑civilisation development**_

<table><thead><tr><th width="130.4000244140625">Year</th><th>Milestone</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>2025 / 2026</strong></td><td><strong>Adoption of the ERDA Codex:</strong> initiation of cosmic responsibility and the start of coordinated build‑up as the foundation for a future‑proof spacefaring civilisation.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2028</strong></td><td><strong>Founding of the Solar Alliance:</strong> establishment of the first bodies and codes for international coordination of spaceflight, realistically supported by modern communication and partnership models.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2029</strong></td><td><strong>Launch of the Lunar Dockyard project:</strong> start of construction of the first sphere modules, with plans for gradual integration of modular manufacturing in lunar orbit.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2030</strong></td><td><strong>Ratification of the cosmos conventions:</strong> first legally binding agreements (including a duty to render assistance) that define the legal framework for responsible activities in outer space.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2032</strong></td><td><strong>Commissioning of the Sphere Craft Assembly Hub:</strong> establishment of a central manufacturing and assembly hub in lunar orbit to modularise the build‑up of space infrastructures.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2034</strong></td><td><strong>Deployment of the first DNS nodes:</strong> installation of decentralised communications and control systems on the Moon and at Lagrange points to strengthen the infrastructural base.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2034</strong></td><td><strong>Solar Defense Force Node – Moon:</strong> establishment of the first Solar Defense Force node on the Moon.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2035</strong></td><td><strong>Commissioning of EARTH ONE:</strong> realisation of an orbital "pair of world eyes" for global monitoring and communication, based on newly established technologies.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2036</strong></td><td><strong>Test operation of the orbital cycler system:</strong> first trials of a continuous orbital transport system between Earth and Mars, enabling regular connections in the long term.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2038</strong></td><td><strong>Start of operations on LUNAR ONE:</strong> activation of a permanent space‑station concept in lunar orbit, supported by a permanent CIVITAS Council as a governance and cooperation body.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2042</strong></td><td><strong>BELT LIVING ONE is crewed:</strong> stationing and start of operations. A six‑month training and preparation programme establishes stable routines.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2042</strong></td><td><strong>Research stations on Mars:</strong> construction of rotating, medically and ethically oriented stations as the first basis for long‑term scientific missions on Mars.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2043</strong></td><td><strong>BELT LIVING ONE travels to the belt:</strong> journey to the asteroid belt. Establishment of the first orbital mining centre in the belt, initiating independent resource utilisation.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2044</strong></td><td><strong>Solar Defense Force Node – Mars:</strong> establishment of the Solar Defense Force node on Mars.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2045</strong></td><td><strong>VENUS ONE is crewed:</strong> VENUS ONE is populated and begins operations. A six‑month training and preparation programme establishes stable routines.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2046</strong></td><td><strong>VENUS ONE travels to Venus:</strong> journey to Venus and start of the first missions. Beginning of ethics and atmosphere missions to explore and shape Venus, with the aim of generating insights for future terraforming processes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2048</strong></td><td><strong>Expansion of the DNS networks:</strong> extension of communications and control systems to Mars and the inner asteroid belt, securing seamless space communication.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2050</strong></td><td><strong>Creation of Mars parliaments and education networks:</strong> setup of administrative units and deeper space‑probe clusters (e.g. IRIS swarm with over 10,000 units) for autonomous steering and exploration of Mars.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2050</strong></td><td><strong>Solar Defense Force Node – Belt:</strong> establishment of the Solar Defense Force node in the asteroid belt.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2052</strong></td><td><strong>Launch of NEPTUNE ONE:</strong> start of an intergenerational long‑term programme integrating families into spaceflight and fostering long‑term settlements in the outer solar system.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2055</strong></td><td><strong>Full operational expansion of the cycler system:</strong> provision of a reliable orbital transport system as far as Neptune for large‑scale cargo and passenger transport in space.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2060</strong></td><td><strong>Expansion of DNS coverage:</strong> creation of a comprehensive control network at all ERDA bases in the asteroid belt and at Neptune, optimising space communication.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2062</strong></td><td><strong>Solar Defense Force Nodes – Beyond:</strong> establishment of Solar Defense Force nodes at every human settlement in the solar system.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2065</strong></td><td><strong>Autonomous lunar industry:</strong> lunar habitats achieve a self‑sufficiency level of over 70%, enabling significant independence in space.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2070</strong></td><td><strong>Intersolar observatory network:</strong> construction of the first near‑real‑time observatory at around 180 AU to monitor distant space phenomena and advance scientific understanding.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2075</strong></td><td><strong>50 years of the ERDA Codex:</strong> celebration of half a century of the ERDA vision with a democratically governed deep‑space environment and a framework of cosmic responsibility as a central pillar of the future spacefaring civilisation.</td></tr></tbody></table>
