# 9.6.2 Here is the possible solution

_**Here is the possible solution**_

_Elaboration of concrete implementation steps based on the recommendations of Chapter 5.1._

_Chapter 5.1 set out strategic recommendations for implementing the SPACE concept. Chapter 5.2 now sketches initial concrete implementation pathways and institutional models for realising these recommendations._

_Chapter 5.2 thus forms the bridge between vision (Chapter 5.1) and manifestations (Chapter 5.3 ff. – major projects of the SOLAR ALLIANCE). It enables an orderly, democratically controlled and responsibility‑based ethical transition into the structured build‑up phase of the space civilisation._

> _"A space project is not complete when it stands. It is complete when it is supported."_
