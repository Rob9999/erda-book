# 9.6.4 Sphere Station LUNAR ONE

_**Sphere Station LUNAR ONE**_

_Sustainable outpost in lunar orbit – gateway to deep space_

Sphere Station LUNAR ONE is the second main structure in the orbital network of the Solar Alliance. Stationed in lunar orbit, it serves as a logistical, scientific and cultural link between Earth, the lunar surface and onward missions to the asteroid belt, to Mars and beyond.

***

#### Location & basic structure

* **Orbit:** Polar‑stabilised lunar orbit (low to medium altitude), with synchronised window intervals to the lunar base, EARTH ONE and Mars transfer windows
* **Capacity:** Up to 400 residents + 80 temporary transit guests + 300 lunar‑based staff and their families
* **Function:** Logistics hub, research, deep‑space coordination, protection station, recuperation for lunar surface crews
* **Modular design:** 127 m in diameter, 15 ring‑shaped decks (DECK 001 to DECK 015) with artificial gravity (rotation), a central, open‑ended axial access with a diameter of 20 m – DECK 000, also called the "Wormhole", serves as the central docking hub and trans‑shipment point. The structure is based on advanced lightweight construction using ceramic silicon‑carbide composite structures (SiC/SiC). The station is largely self‑sufficient, with the exception of specialised goods such as delicacies or highly complex spare parts, which are delivered as part of regular passenger and cargo traffic – on a weekly basis.

#### Technical architecture

* **Energy:** Combination of solar arrays and two small modular reactors (SMRs) (60 MW each) with thermal recovery
* **Communications:** Long‑range networking with Mars cyclers, EARTH ONE and the lunar surface
* **Docking systems:** High‑frequency docking rings for resource transport, crew rotation and research excursions to the surface
* **Regolith shielding modules:** External regolith shields to reduce shocks and radiation from micrometeoroid impacts

***

#### Functions & use

* **Deep‑space logistics:** Preparation, refuelling, supply and trans‑shipment for Mars and asteroid units
* **Lunar platform interface:** Permanent communications and transport link to lunar bases
* **Mining coordination:** Ethical and safety oversight of lunar resource extraction (LUNAR CHARTER of ERDA)
* **Research & technological development:** Long‑term exposure, biological response to low gravity, nanomaterials
* **Cultural modules:** Meditative spaces, Earth/Moon‑view domes, art, architecture and music projects in orbit

***

#### Social structure

* **Resident spectrum:** Technicians, transit travellers, deep‑space preparation teams, cultural delegates
* **Social system:** Rotation and secondment principle with voluntary long‑term deployments of up to 18 months
* **Representation:** LUNAR CIVITAS Council + representation in the central Alliance Council
* **Openness:** Special exchange programmes with belter colonies and youth initiatives

***

#### Symbolism & significance

LUNAR ONE stands at the threshold – between planet and depth, between history and future. It is a place of transition: from gravity to weightlessness, from caution to vision.

> _"Those who enter LUNAR ONE step into the antechamber of our next world."_
