# 9.6.5 Sphere Station BELT LIVING ONE

_**Sphere Station BELT LIVING ONE**_

_Democratic outpost in the asteroid belt – living under conditions of vastness_

Sphere Station BELT LIVING ONE is the first permanent habitat structure in the inner asteroid belt. It marks a milestone: no longer just observation or transit, but deliberate living, research and co‑shaping in deep space. Here it becomes visible whether the democratic principle remains viable under conditions of extreme isolation, distance and autonomy.

#### Location & basic structure

* **Orbit:** Stable transfer orbit in a mid‑belt segment (e.g. between Vesta and Hygiea), though its position in the belt can be changed if required. It is built in lunar orbit and then travels into the belt.
* **Capacity:** 700 permanent residents + 50 rotating research guests
* **Function:** Resource exploration, deep‑space research, habitat development, cultural space, resource extraction, resource trans‑shipment hub
* **Modular design:** 127 m in diameter, 15 ring‑shaped decks (DECK 001 to DECK 015) with artificial gravity (rotation), a central, open‑ended axial access with a diameter of 20 m – DECK 000, also called the "Wormhole", serves as the central docking hub and trans‑shipment point. The structure is based on advanced lightweight construction using ceramic silicon‑carbide composite structures (SiC/SiC). The station can also travel to and within the belt using fusion‑drive clusters around the equator.\
  The station is largely self‑sufficient, with the exception of specialised goods such as delicacies or highly complex spare parts, which are delivered as part of regular passenger and cargo traffic – on a quarterly basis. The station also supplies itself with resources mined in the belt.

#### Technical architecture

* **Energy:** Fusion experiment + thermonuclear buffer + solar support
* **Propulsion unit:** Station‑keeping thrusters for orbit correction + fine‑grained attitude control, fusion‑drive clusters around the equator (maximum thrust 1 MN)
* **Communications:** High‑latency‑resilient systems + semi‑autonomous network structures with CIVITAS protocols
* **Protection:** Radiation shielding, redundant life‑support systems, autonomous repair units
* **Materials:** Hybrid composite with an inner reflector core to create a psychologically more open sense of space

#### Functions & use

* **Asteroid observation & utilisation:** Mapping, resource modelling, technology piloting
* **Long‑term research:** Gravity, long‑term psychology, socio‑dynamics under isolation
* **Food culture:** Autonomous hydroponic systems, diverse mycelium cultures, algae farms
* **Art & reflection:** Poetry circles, long‑form compositions, philosophical logbooks
* **Social micro‑societies & conflict dynamics:** BELT LIVING ONE serves as a long‑term testbed for orbital communities. In an isolated environment, micro‑societies with their own decision‑making processes emerge. Conflict‑resolution formats, consensus models and cyclical feedback rounds are established, supported by resonance mediators and cultures of remembrance (e.g. poetic logbooks, storytelling circles).

***

#### Social structure

* **Resident spectrum:** Voluntary long‑term crew with high levels of training, resource‑extraction specialists and their families
* **Governance:** Self‑governed CIVITAS cell with periodic feedback loops to the Alliance Council
* **Mental health:** Community spaces, cyclical communication windows with Earth, open chambers of remembrance
* **Openness:** Visits by rotating guests, asynchronous schooling formats and family connections possible

***

#### Symbolism & significance

BELT LIVING ONE stands for more than presence. It asks: Can we not only survive but _live_ far from Earth? Can community endure under conditions of vastness, time delay and autonomous structure?
