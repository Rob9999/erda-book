# 9.6.3 Sphere Station EARTH ONE

_**Sphere Station EARTH ONE**_

_Democratically controlled world eyes in geostationary orbit_

Sphere Station EARTH ONE is the first fully developed space platform of the Solar Alliance. It marks the beginning of a new phase of human presence in space: not as an extension of nation‑state interests, but as infrastructure for a democratically mandated global community of responsibility.

#### Location & basic structure

* **Orbit:** Geostationary orbit, synchronised above the equator
* **Capacity:** Up to 700 permanent residents plus 100 guests
* **Function:** Science, communications, monitoring, education, culture, tourism, trade
* **Modular design:** 127 m in diameter, 15 ring‑shaped decks (DECK 001 to DECK 015) with artificial gravity (rotation), a central, open‑ended axial access with a diameter of 20 m – DECK 000, also called the "Wormhole", serves as the central docking hub and trans‑shipment point. The structure is based on advanced lightweight construction using ceramic silicon‑carbide composite structures (SiC/SiC). The station is largely self‑sufficient, with the exception of specialised goods such as delicacies or highly complex spare parts, which are delivered as part of regular passenger and cargo traffic – often on a daily basis.

#### Technical architecture

* **Energy:** Combination of solar arrays and two small modular reactors (SMRs) (60 MW each) with thermal recovery
* **Communications:** High‑speed link to Earth and to other stations (LUNAR, CIVITAS network)
* **Cooling:** Radiator surfaces with PCM systems and adaptive thermal regulation integrated into the hull
* **Radiation protection:** Ceramic‑composite outer layer with MLI insulation
* **Docking ports:** Multi‑purpose modules for cargo, passenger transport and emergency evacuation

***

#### Functions & use

* **Research laboratories:** Microgravity, environmental monitoring, materials testing
* **Education:** Orbital university programmes in cooperation with ERDA partner states
* **Communications:** Satellite coordination, IRIS² integration, orbital CIVITAS gateway
* **Crisis monitoring:** Early‑warning systems for extreme weather, methane, wildfires, migration
* **Culture and public life:** Dome spaces for art, music, exchange, STEM exhibitions

***

#### Social structure

* **Crew composition:** Scientists, technicians, mediators, artists, educators, traders, travellers
* **Normal operations:** Rotation cycles (6–12 months), including family programmes and recreation areas
* **Representation:** Democratically delegated administrative representation (CIVITAS Council on EARTH ONE)
* **Access:** Open visitor programme for young people, scholarship places for disadvantaged regions

#### Symbolism & significance

EARTH ONE is more than infrastructure. It is an expression of the conviction that technology does not simply mean control, but enablement. Its view of Earth is not a surveillance instrument but a mirror of our conscience.

> _"EARTH ONE does not only see the Earth. It sees what we are prepared to do for one another."_
