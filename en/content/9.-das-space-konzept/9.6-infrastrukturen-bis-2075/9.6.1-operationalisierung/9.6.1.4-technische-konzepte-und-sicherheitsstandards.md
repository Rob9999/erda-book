# 9.6.1.4 Technical concepts and safety standards

_**Technical concepts and safety standards**_

* Develop modular and scalable technical concepts that allow for the construction and expansion of the stations.
* Define harmonised concepts for safety, communications and energy – for example by integrating redundant systems and open standards – in order to guarantee both efficiency and resilience.
* Integrate radiation-protection mechanisms and emergency plans that ensure rapid evacuation or repair measures in the event of a crisis.
