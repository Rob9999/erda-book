# 9.6.1 Operationalisation

_**Operationalisation – strategic prerequisites for implementing the SOLAR ALLIANCE space infrastructures**_

_These recommendations operate at different levers – from goal definition via financing and organisation through to technical implementation and international cooperation. By combining these measures, the SOLAR ALLIANCE can not only realise a forward-looking space programme but also serve as a model for a democratically responsible and sustainable spacefaring civilisation._
