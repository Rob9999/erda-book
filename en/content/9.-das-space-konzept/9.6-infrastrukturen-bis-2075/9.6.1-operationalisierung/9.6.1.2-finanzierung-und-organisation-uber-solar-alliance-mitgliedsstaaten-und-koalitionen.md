# 9.6.1.2 Financing and organisation via SOLAR ALLIANCE member states and coalitions

_**Financing and organisation via SOLAR ALLIANCE member states and coalitions**_

* Develop a joint financing model underpinned by the SOLAR ALLIANCE member states – including through existing or newly created coalitions of the willing.
* Create public–private transformation funds that specifically support projects in the field of space infrastructure, while providing for strict democratic control mechanisms.
* Define clear responsibilities and funding shares so that individual modules or functional units can be allocated and supported according to their strategic importance.
