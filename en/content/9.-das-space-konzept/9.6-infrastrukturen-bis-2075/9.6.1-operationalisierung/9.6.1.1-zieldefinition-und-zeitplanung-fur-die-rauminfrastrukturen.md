# 9.6.1.1 Goal definition and timeline for the space infrastructures

_**Goal definition and timeline for the space infrastructures**_

* Define space infrastructures (e.g. sphere stations such as EARTH ONE, LUNAR ONE, BELT LIVING ONE, NEPTUNE ONE and VENUS ONE) as strategic grand objectives.
* Establish milestones starting from the founding of the SOLAR ALLIANCE (e.g. construction of an initial base module within the first five years, expansion and integration of further modules in the subsequent ten years).
* Develop a realistic schedule that covers both short-term and long-term targets (up to 2075) in order to ensure continuous development.
