# 9.6.1.5 International cooperation and citizen participation

_**International cooperation and citizen participation**_

* Promote the integration of civil-society actors via platforms such as CIVITAS so that citizens are involved in decision-making processes at an early stage.
* Develop communication strategies that convincingly convey the shift from traditionally national ideas of space towards a collective, democratically governed space.
* Strengthen cooperation with international partners and regional alliances in order to harness synergies and establish global standards in spaceflight.
