# 9.9. ERDA glossary – key concepts of a spacefaring civilisation

_**ERDA glossary – key concepts of a spacefaring civilisation**_

#### A

**Commons (in outer space)**\
Shared heritage of humankind in space. Encompasses natural resources, frequencies, orbits, and planetary protection zones. Their use is to serve the common good and be governed democratically.

**Androids (autonomous maintenance units)**\
AI‑driven, biomechanically optimised units for maintenance, accompaniment, and crisis response on space stations. Act in accordance with the ethical protocols of the Solar Alliance.

***

#### B

**Belt Living One**\
First permanently inhabited Sphere Station in the asteroid belt. Symbol of democratic deep‑space presence and a place of conscious living under conditions of extreme isolation.

***

#### C

**CIVITAS**\
Democratic communication and participation platform of ERDA. Enables citizens to take part directly in decision‑making, prototyping, and gaining access to orbital decision processes.

**CIVITAS dialogue space**\
Digital‑analogue interface for participatory reflection, mediation, and collective memory. Embedded in space stations and educational institutions of the Solar Alliance.

**CPF – CIVITAS Participation Fund**\
Funding instrument for education, culture, youth projects, and civil‑society co‑creation within the framework of the Solar Alliance.

***

#### D

**DNS – Democratic Navigation & Signal Nodes**\
Quantum‑encrypted communication and synchronisation nodes. Serve as the backbone of orbital infrastructure. Civilian‑controlled, distributed across planetary zones.

***

#### E

**EARTH ONE**\
First large Sphere Station in geostationary orbit. Serves as a civilly controlled “pair of world eyes” and as a platform for science, crisis monitoring, education, and culture.

**ERDA – European Rights‑Based Democratic Alliance**\
Democratic, rule‑of‑law alliance of European and global partner states. Carries the vision of a sustainable, human‑rights‑based spacefaring civilisation.

**Ethics Council for the Cosmos**\
Interdisciplinary advisory body accompanying all infrastructure decisions in outer space. Its foundation is the Codex for Cosmic Responsibility.

***

#### G

**Governance structures (of the Solar Alliance)**\
Include the legislature (Solar Parliament), executive (Alliance Council), judiciary (space law chamber), ethics councils, and civil oversight bodies. Aim: separation of powers and democratic accountability.

***

#### L

**LUNAR CHARTA**\
Ethics and safety code for resource extraction and infrastructure development on the Moon. Part of the codified law of the cosmos of the Solar Alliance.

**LUNAR ONE**\
Sphere Station in lunar orbit. Link between Earth, lunar bases, and deep space. A place for research, logistics, and cultural reflection.

***

#### O

**ORBital Infrastructure Bureau (ORBI)**\
Technical‑administrative unit for implementing and maintaining the space infrastructures of the Solar Alliance.

**Orbital fundamental rights**\
Fundamental rights of people who live or work in orbit. Include protection, participation, medical care, co‑determination, education, data protection, and the right to return.

***

#### S

**SIF – Solar Infra Fund**\
Fund for financing strategic infrastructure projects (e.g. Sphere Stations, reactors, communication systems). Subject to democratic accountability.

**Solar Alliance**\
Multinational institution in the spirit of ERDA. Aim: building a democratic, rule‑of‑law, sustainable, and culturally diverse spacefaring civilisation.

**Solar Codex / Codex for Cosmic Responsibility**\
Foundational legal‑ethical text of the Solar Alliance. Regulates human dignity, resource rights, environmental responsibility, ethics of encounter, and commons principles.

**Solar Defense Force (SDF)**\
Defensive protection structure of the Solar Alliance. Democratically controlled, decentralised in its deployments. No offensive capability – focuses on reconnaissance, deterrence, and rescue.

**Solar Strategy Committee (SSC)**\
Politically coordinating body for the strategic planning of the Solar Alliance. Interface between parliament, alliance council, ethics councils, and the sciences.
