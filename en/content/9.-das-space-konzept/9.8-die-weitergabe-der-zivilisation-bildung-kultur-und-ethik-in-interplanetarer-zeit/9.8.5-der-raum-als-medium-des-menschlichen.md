# 9.8.5 Space as a medium of the human

_**Space as a medium of the human**_

* Resonance architecture as social space: stations that breathe, listen, and remember
* Time culture: synchronising rhythms, planetary days, and personal calendars
* Integration of AI companions into education, remembrance, and ethics processes

> _Perhaps what we build will not remain. But what we share will._
