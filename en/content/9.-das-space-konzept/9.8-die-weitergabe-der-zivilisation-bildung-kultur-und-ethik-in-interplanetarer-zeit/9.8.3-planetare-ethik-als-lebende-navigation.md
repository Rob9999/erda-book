# 9.8.3 Planetary ethics as living navigation

_**Planetary ethics as living navigation**_

* Space ethics as an everyday tool: circulating, reflective, decentralised
* “Rights of life for all inhabitants” as a core principle in education, daily life, and research
* Emergency ethics, terraforming ethics, settlement and contact ethics as ever‑present modes of thinking

> _In space, responsibility does not arise from proximity, but from conscious decision._
