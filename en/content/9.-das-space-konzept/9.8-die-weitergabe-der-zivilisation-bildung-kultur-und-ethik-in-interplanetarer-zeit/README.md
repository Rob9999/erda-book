# 9.8 Passing on civilisation – education, culture and ethics in interplanetary time

_**Passing on civilisation – education, culture and ethics in interplanetary time**_

_What remains when we leave? And what do we carry forward?_

A spacefaring civilisation is not just infrastructure, but a living legacy in motion. This chapter explores how the intellectual, cultural and ethical continuity of humankind can be preserved and carried forward – into a future shaped by distance, time delays and diversity. It is about preservation without stagnation, transmission without dogma, and about a human becoming in interplanetary space.
