# 9.8.2 Memory architecture & collective memory

_**Memory architecture & collective memory**_

* Building an interplanetary archive system (“Solar Memory Grid”) with data curated in poetic, historical, and emotional ways
* Memory chambers on every Sphere Station: places for remembrance ceremonies, storytelling, and connection to Earth
* Spaces for the stories of the many: Indigenous perspectives, migrants, children, and AI voices

> _Civilisation begins where remembering does not exclude, but connects._
