# 9.1.4.1 Codification of Fundamental Principles

_**Codification of fundamental principles**_

As on the world’s oceans, universal principles of coexistence also apply in space:

* Duty to render assistance (e.g. rescue in distress)
* Protection of the commons (e.g. avoidance of orbital debris, planetary protection)
* Prohibition of unfounded claims of ownership
* Cooperation and data sharing as the norm
* Transparent authorisation of every space operation

These principles are to be translated into a **codified body of cosmos law** and made reviewable by an organ of the SOLAR ALLIANCE that is legitimately constituted under public international law.
