# 9.1.3 Building a SOLAR ALLIANCE

ERDA understands the ERDA Codex for Cosmic Responsibility not as a purely European or regional project, but as the nucleus of a future SOLAR ALLIANCE: a democratic community of states and societies that jointly accept responsibility for the Solar System and its life forms. In order to bring this vision into being, two development steps are particularly central: first, a gradual codification of the principles as “cosmos law” in the sense of an extension and further development of existing international law; and second, political, institutional and technological preparation for the actual founding of a SOLAR ALLIANCE.

The codification must build on existing treaties (Outer Space Treaty, Moon Agreement and others), but go far beyond them in terms of democratic responsibility, protection of life and intergenerational justice. The preparation for the founding, in turn, requires diplomatic groundwork, pilot cooperation projects and shared infrastructures that make the advantages and necessity of such an alliance tangible.

Subsections 9.1.3.1 and 9.1.3.2 sketch these two strands in more detail: the legal embedding of the Codex as cosmos law, and the concrete roadmap towards the founding of the SOLAR ALLIANCE by 2028.
