# 9.1.2.6 Justice for All Forms of Life

_**Justice for all forms of life**_

All life forms originating from the solar system have a natural right to exist – including beyond the Earth. They must not be exploited, displaced or manipulated. Their right to develop in accordance with their nature applies within the bounds of overall compatibility in space.
