# 9.1.2.1 Human Dignity and the Rule of Law Also Apply in Space

_**Human dignity and the rule of law also apply in space**_

Every human being retains their inalienable rights – regardless of their place of residence in the solar system. Rights relating to work, residence and participation must be legally enshrined and enforceable.
