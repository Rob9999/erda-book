# 9.1.2.4 Technological Openness and Freedom of Knowledge

_**Technological openness and freedom of knowledge**_

Scientific results from public missions must be openly accessible. Knowledge is a commons. Patents must not obstruct democratically governed, legally grounded innovations of societal relevance, but must live up to their social responsibility. Free scientific exploration by non-state actors is permissible provided it serves the democratic, rule-of-law based common good, is conducted transparently, and is ethically reviewable.
