# 9.1.1 Preamble

_**Preamble**_

Outer space is not property. It is not a market, not a theatre of war, not a refuge of power.\
Outer space is the **resonance space of humanity** – open to all, to be protected for future generations and a mirror of our inner progress.

In the spirit of the _European Rights-Based Democratic Alliance (ERDA)_ and borne by the vision of a _Solar Alliance_ for global cooperation and peace, this Codex commits to extending the principles of democratic rule of law to the new field of action of the cosmos.
