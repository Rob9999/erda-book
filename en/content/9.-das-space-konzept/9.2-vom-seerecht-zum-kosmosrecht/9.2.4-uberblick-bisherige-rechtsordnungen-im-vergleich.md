# 9.2.4 Overview – Previous Legal Orders in Comparison

_**Overview – previous legal orders in comparison**_

The development of the law of the sea provides valuable guidance for building a future-proof cosmos law. Both fields of law deal with spaces that do not belong to any single state, but are increasingly used economically, technologically and geopolitically. Nevertheless, they differ in maturity, enforcement and ethical foundations.

| Category                           | International law of the sea (UNCLOS etc.)                                   | Existing space law (Outer Space Treaty etc.)                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Legal status**                  | Codified in international law, recognised by almost all states                | Partially codified (OST 1967), but without comprehensive implementation or sanctions     |
| **Concept of commons**            | "Seabed as the common heritage of humankind"                                | "Outer space for all humankind", but without a defined commons administration          |
| **Duty to rescue**                | Duty of rescue at sea clearly defined (SOLAS, SAR Convention)                | No formal duty to rescue in emergencies in orbit or on celestial bodies                  |
| **Resource utilisation**          | Deep sea mining regulated via the International Seabed Authority             | No binding regulation of resource extraction on the Moon, Mars or asteroids              |
| **Environmental protection**      | Contains principles for the protection of marine ecosystems (e.g. MARPOL)    | Environmental issues in space largely unregulated (e.g. space debris, planetary protection) |
| **Institutional anchoring**       | International Maritime Organisation (IMO), International Seabed Authority (ISA) | No equivalent enforcement body in outer space                                           |
| **Technological access**          | Access to maritime use regulated in law through UN conventions               | Technological access dominated by private actors and spacefaring nations                 |
| **Citizen participation / transparency** | Partly established in environmental procedures (e.g. inclusion of NGOs) | Hardly any citizen participation in the space sector                                     |

> Conclusion: For all its enforcement weaknesses, the law of the sea is a structured order, safeguarded under international law. Space law, by contrast, is in a pre-democratic state – with normative declarations of intent, but without institutional guarantees.

The path towards a SOLAR ALLIANCE begins with transferring the proven principles of the law of the sea to the cosmos – expanded by ethical, ecological and democratic dimensions as formulated in the spirit of ERDA.
