# 9.2.3 The Contemporary Civilisation – Including in its Democratic Maturity

_**The contemporary civilisation – including in its democratic maturity**_

Despite all progress in human rights, international law and technological cooperation, todays civilisation remains contradictory in many areas: democratic states still accept global inequality in access to resources  both on Earth and in orbit.

The law of the sea has indeed achieved progress with the principle of rescue at sea, the maritime commons and international agreements, but these are often weakened by national interests, economic exemptions and a lack of enforcement.

In space, these tensions become even more visible:

* Privatised satellite networks without global regulation.
* Orbital positions dominated by a small number of states.
* Questions of resources on the Moon, Mars and asteroids  largely unregulated.
* No duty to provide assistance in emergencies.
* No uniform environmental standards for planetary protection zones.

Even democratic civilisations have so far failed to establish a binding code for cosmic behaviour. Binding institutions, clear ethical standards and citizen participation in the space sector are lacking.

Yet it is precisely this phase of maturity that offers the opportunity to change course: within democratic self-reflection and the capacity for correction lies the potential for a new order beyond Earth. The SOLAR ALLIANCE  as a legally codified, democratically controlled and ethically legitimate structure  is not a break with todays civilisation, but its consistent further development.
