# 9.2.2 The Pre-democratic Civilisation

_**The pre-democratic civilisation**_

Before the emergence of modern democracies, open space – whether sea or orbit – was a place of power projection. Those who possessed technology and strength imposed their will. The world’s oceans were colonised, exploited, measured and divided up in the colours of flags. The weaker became an object – the stronger became the judge.

The natural longings for protection, justice and reciprocity mostly remained unfulfilled in this phase, or were granted only within narrow communities of belonging. Rendering assistance was the exception, not an obligation. Resources were regarded as spoils to be conquered – not as a shared basis of survival.

In such a world, the vacuum of order was not an empty space – but a field of inequality.

Many current principles of spaceflight logic still resemble this pattern: orbital positions as an exclusive good. Technological advantage as an instrument of power. Outer space as a theatre of strategic dominance. A pre-democratic echo in postmodern armament.

ERDA’s path consciously leads out of this phase – through the binding force of law, shared responsibility and structural justice in the cosmos.
