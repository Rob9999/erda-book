# 9.2.5 The Development Arc towards the SOLAR ALLIANCE

_**The development arc towards the SOLAR ALLIANCE**_

The SOLAR ALLIANCE is a natural emergence and consistent continuation of a civilisational maturation movement. It is not intended to clear the way out of the Earths sphere for our unresolved shadows, but to shape and preserve a democratic, rule-of-law-based, just and sustainable space of resonance and life for human beings – and all who follow them. A solar, interplanetary community of responsibility from the 21st century to the next natural emergence and, perhaps – yes, perhaps – far beyond.

**From intention to institution**

What today exists in the law of the sea and parts of space law as an "intention" – for example, the use of outer space for the benefit of all – must become a binding institution within the SOLAR ALLIANCE:

* with **democratic legitimacy**,
* **clear standards** for the allocation of resources, assistance and environmental protection,
* and **citizen participation** that does not decouple the cosmos, but understands it as an expanded space of life and responsibility.

**The SOLAR ALLIANCE as a civilisational goal**

The SOLAR ALLIANCE is more than a technical or legal instrument. It is the expression of a civilisation that has learned to use its means in harmony with its values. It translates the natural longings – for protection, participation, fairness, meaning – into resilient structures. It is what the "best form of democracy" can be in space.

**Time horizon: 2028 as a realistic target mark**

The years up to 2028 can be used to:

* form an international consortium of democratic states,
* prepare a founding agreement for the SOLAR ALLIANCE,
* draft minimum legal and institutional standards,
* and secure citizen participation through platforms such as **CIVITAS**.

This alliance would not be a world state, but a cosmopolitan framework – with shared values, contractual binding force and openness to further members. It forms the ethical and legal foundation of a space civilisation in the spirit of ERDA.

> The SOLAR ALLIANCE is not a vision for later. It is the next logical step for a democracy that takes itself seriously – a natural emergence and consistent continuation of a civilisational maturation movement.
