# 9.2.1 Natural Longings in Open Space (Sea or Cosmos)

_**Natural longings in open space (sea or cosmos)**_

Where the horizon dissolves – whether on the world’s oceans or in the black shimmer of outer space – the same basic human need stirs within us: orientation, protection, reliability. The vastness itself is not dangerous – it only becomes dangerous when humans encounter it without order, without measure and without compassion.

From this existential experience arise fundamental longings that guide civilisational action:

* **The longing for orientation:** Where am I? Who am I here? What applies in this place?
* **The longing for protection:** Who helps me if I am adrift? Who protects me from violence?
* **The longing for justice:** May everyone pass through here? Or only the stronger?
* **The longing for reciprocity:** If I help – will others help me too?
* **The longing for participation:** Can I act, live and contribute here – or am I only an object?
* **The longing for meaning:** What do our actions in space say about us ourselves?
* **The longing for settlement:** May I settle and retain what I extract, cultivate or earn?
* **The longing for water, food, air:** Can I survive where I am travelling to? Who secures the vital resources for me?

These longings are not political ideals, but anthropological constants. They are embedded just as much in seafaring traditions as in today’s astronautical missions. Ignoring them produces arbitrariness, abuse of power and tragedy.

In the ERDA context they are not treated as mere appeals, but as the normative core of a future cosmos law: what has proven itself over centuries at sea deserves its further development in space.
