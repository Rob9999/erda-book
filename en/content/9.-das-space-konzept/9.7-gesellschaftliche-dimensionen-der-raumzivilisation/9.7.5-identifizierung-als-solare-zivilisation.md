# 9.7.5 Identification as a solar civilisation

_**Identification as a solar civilisation**_

A spacefaring civilisation in the spirit of ERDA is not merely an extension of geographical reach – it is the birth of a new form of identity. A solar identity does not arise from uniform, flag or power, but from shared values, responsibility and mutual recognition.

**Shared symbols and rituals**

* Introduction of a symbol of the solar civilisation: for example, a stylised solar disc with an orbital resonance path.
* Orbital oath: a voluntary declaration of commitment to responsibility for the solar system.
* Holidays of connection: founding day of the SOLAR ALLIANCE, day of the ERDA Constitution, day of the solar space.

**Planetary transcendence**

* Refinement of national origin as an ethical cultural root, with "I am a solar citizen" as the primary category of identification.
* Linking planetary origin with interplanetary responsibility.
* Formation of a community of remembrance: "We come from Earth – and act in the name of many worlds."

**Cosmopolitan sense of belonging**

* Fostering an open, plural identity beyond origin, language or status.
* A sense of participation in something greater: the protection and shaping of the entire solar system.
* Development of a new narrative: _We are a solar civilisation – not because we went outwards, but because we connected._

#### Orbital Citizenship Index (public research)

* To assess the democratic maturity of orbital communities, an "Orbital Citizenship Index" is introduced.
* It measures criteria such as participation, ethical binding, transparency, social cohesion and psychological resilience.
* The index supports the continuous further development of orbital democratic practice and feeds into the Solar Alliance’s funding strategies.

> _Solar identity does not arise from distance – but from proximity to responsibility._
