# 9.7 Societal dimensions of a spacefaring civilisation

_**Societal dimensions of a spacefaring civilisation**_

_What does it mean to be human – beyond Earth?_

The technical realisation of a spacefaring civilisation is only part of the task. The real challenge lies in the question: **How do we live there?** How do we shape community, meaning, identity and responsibility in places where no river flows, no tree stands, no atmosphere makes breathing easier? This chapter is dedicated to the social, cultural and ethical construction of orbital societies.

> _A spacefaring civilisation is not only what it builds. It is what it remembers – and what people tell one another._
