# 9.7.2 Social models & participation

_**Social models & participation**_

What does democratic coexistence look like when there are no nations, no old ownership structures, no historical claims? In space, belonging is not a birth right but a jointly chosen community of responsibility. This section explores new forms of statehood, family, generations and participation in orbit.

**Orbital citizenship**

* Residents of space stations receive their own orbital‑democratic citizenship.
* Rights and duties are oriented towards the ERDA Codex and embedded in CIVITAS interfaces.
* Dual citizenship is possible (home state + orbital citizenship).

**Democracy in weightlessness**

* Micro‑parliaments on the stations with rotating delegations.
* Digital votes, conciliation forums and day‑to‑day referendums on orbital basic rights.
* Symbolic rituals of co‑decision (e.g. "frequency choice", spatial‑sound ballots).

**Family and generations in space**

* Forms of life: patchwork crews, multi‑parent models, collective communities of children.
* Birth, care and dying in space: new forms of care and connectedness.
* Long‑term stations as places of home: psychological, social and ethical design of growing up, ageing and belonging.

> _Democracy in space is not a copy of Earth – but a new beginning in the light of the stars._
