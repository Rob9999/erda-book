# 9.7.3 Ethics & law in everyday life

_**Ethics & law in everyday life**_

What does justice mean when help is hours away? How is trust formed when there is nowhere to withdraw to? Everyday life in orbit calls for an ethics of proximity that does not suppress conflict but works through it constructively – and for a legal framework that is not rigid but breathing, humane and situationally aware.

**Everyday morality in extreme situations**

* Closeness under conditions of limited space: how do we deal with stress, sensory overload and isolation?
* Conflicts as part of communal life: building de‑escalating cultures of communication.
* Consensus orientation instead of punishment: space law as the law of living, focused on dignity, reparation and mediation.

**Forms of remembrance and collective memory**

* Orbital archives: thoughts, images, stories – fed by daily entries, poetic logbooks, CIVITAS conversation spaces.
* Rituals for preserving meaning: space diaries, memory capsules, birthday gravity.
* Space‑time holidays: connecting to Earth, annual cycles, cosmic events.

**Psychosocial resilience and support**

* Mediation and conflict support as permanent facilities on every station.
* Orbital companions: trained resonance tutors, memory educators, psycho‑philosophical mediators.
* Orbital health concepts: psychosomatic care, resonance architecture, design of sleep rhythms.

> _Ethics in space is not law plus technology. It is relationship under conditions of finitude._
