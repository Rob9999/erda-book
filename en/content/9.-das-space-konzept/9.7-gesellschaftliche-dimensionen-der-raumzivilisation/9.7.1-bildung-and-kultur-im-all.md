# 9.7.1 Education & culture in space

_**Education & culture in space**_

In a world beyond the world, education needs new horizons. It must not focus only on knowledge and function but also carry resonance, reflection and a will to the future. Education in space is more than didactics – it is an act of locating oneself: _Where am I? Who are we? What does humanity mean beyond the planet?_

**Orbital education networks**

* Creation of interplanetary university alliances with hybrid teaching between Earth, the Moon and space stations.
* Digital platforms with democratic access via CIVITAS for all age groups.
* Focus on integrative space curricula: environmental ethics, orbital law, technology reflection, deep‑space history.

**Arts and cultural forms**

* Music in weightlessness, sound bodies in vacuum, new forms of composition with AI coupling.
* Orbital painting and sculpture: material art with ceramic, reflective and fluid media.
* Narrative cultures: story cafés, floating poetry, deep‑space theatre – for negotiating shared meaning.

**Education as resonance**

* Learning becomes a collective process of reflection: participatory, meaning‑oriented, co‑resonant.
* Cultural education as a resonance space for identity and civilisational memory.
* Space stations as islands of knowledge and meaning: education not as instruction but as a relationship with the world.

> _An education that does not touch the sky misses space._
