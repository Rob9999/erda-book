# 9.4.1 Strategic Necessities

_**Strategic necessities**_

**a) Autonomy and sovereignty**

* Independent access to space secures Europe’s capacity to act in crises.
* Orbital infrastructure protects communication networks, navigation and cyber security.
* Own launch systems, data centres and stations strengthen strategic resilience.

**b) Environmental monitoring and early warning**

* Space-based sensors enable early warning of extreme weather, droughts, fires, permafrost changes and methane releases.
* Data-driven environmental policy can be shaped more precisely and more democratically with the help of orbital real-time data.

**c) Security and protection**

* Early-warning systems (e.g. IRIS²), detection of space debris and EMP risks.
* Orbital resilience systems against collisions, cyber attacks and infrastructure failures.
* Democratically controlled security infrastructure protects civil society, not power interests.
