# 9.4 Why Spaceflight? – Strategic and Civilisational Motives in the Spirit of ERDA

_**Why spaceflight? – Strategic and civilisational motives in the spirit of ERDA**_

_The question “why spaceflight?” is not a technical one, but a civilisational one. In the spirit of ERDA it is not answered simply with “because we can”, but with a compass of values: spaceflight should expand human development, widen responsibility and deepen perspectives. It is both tool and mirror._\
