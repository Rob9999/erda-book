# 9.4.3 Spiritual Responsibility in Space

_**Spiritual responsibility in space**_

**a) Protecting commons, not colonising**

* Outer space is not a raw-materials market but a place of collective responsibility.
* Resources are to be developed – _not privatised._
* Commons include: frequency spectra, orbital slots, planetary protection zones, energy flows.

**b) An ethics of encounter**

* Who decides on terraforming, extraction and settlement?
* What rights do future generations or non-human life have?
* How do we relate to hypothetical extraterrestrial intelligence?

**c) Spaceflight as a test of democratic maturity**

* Only a democratic civilisation can credibly assume responsibility for space.
* Spaceflight without ethics becomes an instrument of geopolitical power projection.
* Spaceflight with ethics becomes an expansion of humanity.

**d) Fair access**

* Access to spaceflight must not be determined solely by capital or power monopolies.
* Fair participation of states, private actors and civil society requires clear rules and democratic oversight.
