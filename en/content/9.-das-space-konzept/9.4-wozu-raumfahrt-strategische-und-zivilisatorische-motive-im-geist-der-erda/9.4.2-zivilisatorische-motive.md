# 9.4.2 Civilisational Motives

_**Civilisational motives**_

**a) Expanding human possibilities**

* Research in microgravity, biology, materials science and AI coupling.
* New forms of living together beyond national borders.
* A new resonance space for education, culture, ethics and technology.

**b) A shift of perspective on Earth**

* The view from space makes planetary responsibility tangible.
* Interdependence becomes visible: atmosphere, oceans, ice cycles, migration, weather.
* Spaceflight creates awareness: Earth is finite, life is vulnerable.

**c) Expression of creative fulfilment**

* Spaceflight is an expression of human imagination.
* It connects technology with vision, science with meaning.
* It is a form of cultural self-transcendence – not an end in itself.
