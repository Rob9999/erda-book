# Appendix H: Failed Power Structures of Humanity

_**Failed Power Structures of Humanity**_

## H.1 Introduction

Human history shows a multitude of political and social power structures whose existence must always be measured against one elementary goal of life: life itself. Enabling, fostering, and protecting life is ethically fundamental and evolutionarily self‑evident. Conversely, structures that damage or even destroy life are necessarily failed, because they violate the very purpose of existence. The following essay explains these life‑damaging power structures, presents them in an overview table, and outlines possible measures for their short‑ and long‑term overcoming.

## H.2 Overview of Central Power Structures

## H.3 Interpretation and Assessment

Each of these structures fundamentally contradicts the ethical principle of preserving life. Totalitarianism and authoritarianism systematically suppress human flourishing through permanent control and the threat of violence, while military dictatorships terrorise the population directly through force of arms and authoritarian measures.

Theocracies and absolute monarchies misuse religion or traditional claims to restrict freedoms. One‑party systems exclude genuine political competition and cement power in the hands of a few, while kleptocracies abuse a country’s resources for personal enrichment and thus indirectly produce deadly poverty.

Imperialism – historical or modern – subjugates foreign populations, often through war and violence, depriving them of the possibility of autonomous development. Slavery and apartheid systems destroy the dignity and integrity of entire population groups. Regimes of terror use fear and violence to secure their own power, and violent anarchy eliminates any protection and structure for life and security.

## H.4 Paths to Overcoming

To overcome these destructive systems in a sustainable way, short‑term measures such as targeted sanctions, diplomatic isolation, or humanitarian interventions are necessary. In the long term, however, education, international cooperation, the development of the rule of law and democracy, and social integration are indispensable to ensure that life is protected and fostered rather than threatened by power‑political interests.
