# 6.8 Concluding reflections

_**Concluding reflections**_

_An infrastructure for Europe’s democratic future_

CIVITAS is more than a technical project. It is a strategic pillar of European democracy. It creates a public space in which freedom, participation and responsibility can unfold digitally – sovereign, protected and open to all who wish to help shape a pluralistic future for Europe.

> _CIVITAS is the infrastructure of the digital self‑assertion of free democracies._
