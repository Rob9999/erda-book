# 6.7 Education, youth & democratic participation

_**Education, youth & democratic participation**_

Democracy lives from participation – especially that of the younger generation:

* CIVITAS offers secure access for schools, universities and youth councils.
* Support for civic education and digital self‑efficacy.
* Participatory tools for projects, votes and political learning spaces.
