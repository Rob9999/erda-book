# 6.1 Guiding idea: democracy in the digital sphere

_**Guiding idea: democracy in the digital sphere**_

In an era of growing uncertainty, increasing polarisation and algorithmically driven manipulation, Europe needs a digital counterweight – a democratically controlled, citizen‑centred and technologically sovereign network. CIVITAS is this counterweight. Not as a replica of commercial platforms, but as a new institutional sphere: reliable, participatory, pluralistic.

> _CIVITAS is not a European Twitter. It is the digital agora of a self‑confident democracy._

CIVITAS combines social‑network functions with the rule of law, public accountability and direct citizen participation. It is the digital infrastructure for participation, freedom of expression and democratic self‑efficacy in the 21st century.
