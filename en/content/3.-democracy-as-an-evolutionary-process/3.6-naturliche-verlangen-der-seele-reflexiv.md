_**Natural desires of the soul (reflexive)**_

| Natural desires of the soul – seven paths to resonance | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🗯️ **Freedom**                                         | Not as arbitrariness, but as self-unfolding in harmony with one's nature |
| 🔎 **Truth**                                           | The longing to look behind the veil – to recognise what is real       |
| ❤️ **Connectedness**                                   | The feeling of being part of something greater – beyond loneliness    |
| 🌱 **Growth**                                          | Not just knowledge – but maturity, depth, experience                  |
| 💫 **Meaning**                                         | Finding a significance that carries – through pain and over time      |
| 🌍 **Influence**                                       | Being allowed to touch the world – not as power, but as co-creation   |
| 🧘 **Rest**                                            | Being in harmony with oneself – finding a home within                 |

In the spirit of ERDA, the natural desires of the soul are interwoven with democratic practice: freedom, truth, connectedness, growth, meaning, influence and rest shape our collective understanding of participation and the common good.

### 3.6.1 Introduction and core impulses

The seven desires of the soul are not individual privileges, but collective resources: they nourish democratic spaces of resonance and enable deeper forms of co-creation.

**Core impulses:**

- **Freedom as self-unfolding:** Democracy needs autonomous actors who also assume responsibility.
- **Truth through dialogue:** Genuine understanding arises in open exchange, not in monologue.
- **Meaning through participation:** Political decisions gain depth when they rest on shared significance.
- **Rest as a space for reflection:** Democracy lives from pausing and weighing, not from activism alone.

### 3.6.2 Deep dive and analysis

| Desire              | Democratic resonance                                     | Example                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🗯️ **Freedom**      | Self-responsibility instead of egoism                    | Voluntary work on a municipal council      |
| 🔎 **Truth**        | Transparent information and fact-based debates           | Open data portals                          |
| ❤️ **Connectedness** | Solidarity networks and collective identity             | Citizens' forums with diverse voices       |
| 🌱 **Growth**       | Continuous learning and capacity to adapt                | Policy labs with iterative pilot projects  |
| 💫 **Meaning**      | Narrative storytelling that motivates action             | Future workshops in schools                |
| 🌍 **Influence**    | Fair access to participation and resources               | E-participation accessible to everyone     |
| 🧘 **Rest**         | Space for reflection and consensus-building              | Meditation breaks in plenary sessions      |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Create deliberate "islands of reflection" during debates – five minutes of silence before the next round of decisions.
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Democracy of acceleration ≠ reflective democracy – without pauses, the capacity for judgement withers.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Lack of resonance with fundamental needs leads to disillusionment with politics and to populism.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Democracy is not a race – it is a shared riverbed that needs both erosion and growth."
