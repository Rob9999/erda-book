# 3.5 Virtue as a precondition for democratic shaping

_**Virtue as a precondition for democratic shaping**_

> _"Virtue is the music that emerges from freedom and responsibility."_

In Aristotelian philosophy, **virtue (_aretē_)** is not moral superiority, but a form of **intellectual excellence** in action – the capacity to find the right measure, to mediate between extremes, to place the common good above mere self-interest. Virtue is not innate. It is **lived practice**, wisdom incarnate.

A democratic order without virtue is like a ship without a helmsman – it may have a strong sail, but without orientation it will lose itself in the winds of its own possibilities.

Especially in times of technological omnipotence, democracy needs new virtues: **technological moderation**, **courageous transparency**, **joy in responsibility**. The citizen of tomorrow is not only a voter or consumer – they are a co-creator of reality.  
And for that, we need not only knowledge – but character.

If we want to shape our future democratically, we must learn to understand **virtue as collective infrastructure**: not as coercion, but as resonance – not as discipline, but as an expression of dignity.

### 3.5.1 Introduction and core impulses

Democracy is more than an institutional framework – it is an **attitude** that links freedom with responsibility.  
Without individual and collective virtue, it withers into administration or degenerates into arbitrariness.

**Core impulses:**

- **Freedom needs character:** Self-binding and responsibility open the way to genuine participation.
- **Virtue can be learned:** Ethics grows through practice, experience and reflective action.
- **Resonance competence:** Ethical action connects individual well-being with the common good.
- **Applied ethics:** Rules are not enough – lived values are indispensable.

### 3.5.2 Deep dive and analysis

| Dimension                  | Deficient democracy             | Virtue-based democracy                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Understanding of freedom** | Unlimited self-realisation    | Ethics of responsibility as the foundation    |
| **Institutional trust**    | Formalism and rule-following    | Integrity and leading by example              |
| **Handling of conflict**   | Polarisation and dogmatism      | Ability to engage in dialogue and respectful difference |
| **Capacity for innovation** | Clinging to the status quo     | Willingness to experiment and to learn through correction |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Initiate municipal "virtue labs" to practise integrity, respect and responsibility.
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Norm control ≠ virtue ethics – rules without attitude become empty rituals.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Democracies without virtue open the door to populism, corruption and institutional decay.
