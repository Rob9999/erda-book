# 11. The Citizen Concept

This chapter bundles concepts that strengthen democratic resilience not only institutionally, but **practically in everyday life**: through education, duties, rights, incentives, service models, and forms of participation.

The focus is on approaches that are **evolutionarily stable** (socially sustainable, incentive-compatible, and durable over the long term) and can be introduced step by step **at national level or EU-wide**.
