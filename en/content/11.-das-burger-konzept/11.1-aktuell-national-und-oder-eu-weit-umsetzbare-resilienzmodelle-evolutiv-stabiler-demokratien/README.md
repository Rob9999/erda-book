# 11.1 Resilience models currently implementable (national and/or EU-wide)

This subchapter collects models that can be introduced step by step in the short term (within existing constitutional and institutional frameworks).

The goal is to increase resilience in a **measurable** way: defence capability, civil protection, infrastructure stability, the skills base, social cohesion, and ecological future-readiness.
