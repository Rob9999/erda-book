# 11.1.1 Resilience-strengthening citizen duty model

<!-- note: Draft placeholder. Full translation pending review. Structure is preserved to keep links stable. -->

## Implementation-ready concept for a citizen duty model in Germany

This page mirrors the German source structure and introduces a five-part citizen duty model:

- Social duty
- Technical duty
- Economic duty
- Military duty
- Environmental duty (added as the 5th mandatory service)

Key idea: democratic resilience is strengthened not only through defence, but also through civil protection, infrastructure, skills development, social cohesion, and ecological future-readiness.

## Environmental duty (5th duty) — core elements

- Restoration & renaturation (e.g., peatland rewetting, floodplain restoration, forest conversion)
- Environmental monitoring & resilience indicators (water quality, biodiversity, early warning)
- Municipal climate adaptation (sponge city, de-sealing, heat action plans)
- Environmental education / advisory support

<!-- note: Translate section-by-section once terminology is reviewed; keep headings aligned with DE. -->
