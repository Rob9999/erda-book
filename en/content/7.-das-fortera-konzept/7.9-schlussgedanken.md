# 7.9 Concluding Reflections

_**Concluding reflections**_

This document is a call for the **active strategic self-assertion of Europe and its democratic partners**. It is about more than tariffs – it is about dignity, freedom, agency and responsibility in a multipolar world. You cannot defeat protectionism with protectionism. But through an alliance of responsible democracies, you can confront it – intelligently, openly, strongly and justly.
