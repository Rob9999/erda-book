# 7.5 Rethinking the Transatlantic Partnership

_**Rethinking the Transatlantic Partnership**_

* **Preserving willingness to cooperate**: Continue close cooperation with the United States, as long as shared values are upheld.
* **Preparing for independence**: Build robust alternatives in case of US blockades or tariff increases:
  * Independent financial infrastructure (e.g. a European payment system).
  * Technological and energy sovereignty.
  * Crisis protocols for international companies.

> _Strategic partnership must be based on reciprocity – not on one-sided adaptation._
