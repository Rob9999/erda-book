# 7.4 Building Democratic Trade Alliances ("Democracy Trade Network")

_**Building democratic trade alliances ("Add-On Global")**_

* **Democratic trade instead of resource nationalism**: Establishment of a "Democracy Trade Network" with Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, South Korea, Costa Rica and others.
* **Future-oriented free-trade zones**: Tariff-free access and cooperation agreements for key technologies, climate-protection products and digital infrastructure.
* **Reliability through constitutional anchoring**: Trade agreements with states bound by the rule of law promote not only trade but also trust.

> _Free trade only works among equals – not under coercion._
