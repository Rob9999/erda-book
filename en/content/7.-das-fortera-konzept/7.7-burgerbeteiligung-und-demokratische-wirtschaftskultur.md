# 7.7 Citizen Participation & Democratic Economic Culture

_**Citizen participation & democratic economic culture**_

* **Platforms for citizen participation** (e.g. digital participatory budgets, participation platforms, transparent industrial policy).
* **Public debate on strategic resilience**: In the media, education and communities.
* **Fair distribution**: No resilience concept without social cushioning – for example through transformation dividends and co-determination.

> _Resilience begins with the self-efficacy of citizens._
