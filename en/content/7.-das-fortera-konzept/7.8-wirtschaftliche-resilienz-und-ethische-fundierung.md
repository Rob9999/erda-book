# 7.8 Economic Resilience and Ethical Foundations

_**Philosophical basis: Resilience is freedom**_

> "The natural desire of every form of life is: to exist, to unfold, to pass on, to enter into connection – and, at some point, perhaps to understand why."

* Economic resilience is an expression of the desire for self-determination.
* Production sovereignty is the protection of social dignity.
* International cooperation is the civilisational equivalent of connection.

> _Democracies are vulnerable – but they are also capable of learning. This concept is not a retreat – but a step towards conscious connectedness with the world._
