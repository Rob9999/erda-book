# 7.3 Production sovereignty and strategic industrial policy

_**Production sovereignty and strategic industrial policy**_

* **Reindustrialisation with responsibility**: Promotion of future technologies such as semiconductors, renewable energies, batteries, medical technology, spaceflight and AI.
* **Regional value creation**: Strengthening European supply chains with a focus on resilience rather than maximum efficiency.
* **European substitutes for critical US goods**: Building alternative capacities for military systems (e.g. FCAS instead of F‑35), strategic basic materials (green hydrogen-based steel instead of imported steel), energy sources (hydrogen and SMRs instead of LNG), digital infrastructure (European cloud and AI systems).
* **Public–private transformation funds**: Long‑term investment guarantees for structurally important industries.

> _Economic autonomy is not isolationism – it is the foundation of democratic capacity to act._
