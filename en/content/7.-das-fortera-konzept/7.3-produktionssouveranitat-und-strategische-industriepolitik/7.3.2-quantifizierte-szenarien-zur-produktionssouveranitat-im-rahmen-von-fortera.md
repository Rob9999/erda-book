# 7.3.2 Quantified Scenarios for Production Sovereignty within FORTERA

_**Quantified scenarios for production sovereignty within FORTERA**_

_Strategic sectors and target settings_

The following industrial sectors have been identified as particularly critical for Europe’s long-term economic resilience and strategic autonomy:

1. **Semiconductor production**
   * Target 2030: Increase domestic production from the current 10% to at least 35% of EU demand.
   * Target 2045: Increase to 70% domestic production.
   * Expected investment: EUR 150–200 billion via public funding and private investment (50/50).
   * Projected GDP impact: Increase of 0.4% by 2030 and up to 1.2% by 2045.
2. **Energy technologies (including SMRs and renewable energies)**
   * Target 2030: 40 new SMR reactors in operation; share of renewable energies rises to 65%.
   * Target 2045: 100 SMR reactors; renewable energies at 80%.
   * Expected investment: EUR 350 billion by 2030; by 2045 a further EUR 500 billion (60% public, 40% private).
   * Employment effect: approx. 1 million new jobs across Europe by 2045.
3. **Hydrogen-based steel production**
   * Target 2030: Replace 25% of steel imports with European hydrogen steel.
   * Target 2045: Achieve 75% self-sufficiency in low-emission steel.
   * Investments: Around EUR 100 billion, combined from EU transformation funds and industrial partnerships.
   * CO₂ reduction: 60 million tonnes per year by 2035; in the long term 150 million tonnes per year.
4. **Cloud and IT infrastructure**
   * Target 2030: Establish an independent EU cloud infrastructure (EU Sovereignty Cloud) for critical applications.
   * Target 2045: Full independence from non-European cloud services in strategic sectors.
   * Investments: EUR 80–120 billion, with a focus on public–private partnerships.
   * Effect on digital resilience: Reduction of cyber risks by an estimated 75%.
5. **Aviation and defence (FCAS)**
   * Target 2035: Replace at least 30% of imported aviation systems with FCAS.
   * Target 2045: 80% of air defence capabilities based on European systems.
   * Investment needs: EUR 200 billion by 2045 (70% public, 30% private).
   * Employment growth: 250,000 jobs, particularly in high-technology sectors.
