# 7.3.5 Practical Measures and Milestone Planning (2025–2050)

_**Practical measures and milestone planning (2025–2050)**_

1. **Defined milestones**

* **2025–2030**: Initial investments, establishment of the first production lines for semiconductors, SMRs and cloud infrastructure.
* **2030–2035**: Achievement of the first key production targets (semiconductors: 35%, SMR reactors: 40 units, hydrogen steel: 25%). First FCAS prototypes take to the air.
* **2035–2040**: Expansion of existing capacities, growth in production and establishment of European supply chains. FCAS begins the operational replacement of imported systems.
* **2040–2045**: Strategic autonomy in the sectors of semiconductors, energy, steel production and defence is largely achieved.
* **2045–2050**: Completion of the transition phase, evaluation and optimisation of existing infrastructures and production capacities.

2. **Role of the Democracy Trade Network**

* Building strategic cooperation with international democracies to secure critical raw materials, exchange knowledge and jointly develop technologies.
* Coordinated crisis management and resilience-building through mutual support in the event of production bottlenecks and market disruptions.
