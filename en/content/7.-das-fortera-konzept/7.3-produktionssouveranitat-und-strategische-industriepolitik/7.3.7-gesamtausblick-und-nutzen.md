# 7.3.7 Overall Outlook and Benefits

_**Overall outlook and benefits**_

Implementing these goals significantly strengthens Europe’s strategic sovereignty and creates measurable economic and societal added value. Total investments of around EUR 1 trillion by 2045 are expected to lead to a long-term GDP increase of 3 to 5%, accompanied by substantial emissions reductions and the creation of at least 1.5 million new jobs.

These investments enable Europe to become less dependent on geopolitical uncertainties, promote innovation, increase societal prosperity and establish durable, resilient economic structures.
