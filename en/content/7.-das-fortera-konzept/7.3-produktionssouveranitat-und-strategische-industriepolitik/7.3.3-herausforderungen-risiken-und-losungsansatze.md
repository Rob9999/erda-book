# 7.3.3 Challenges, Risks and Solution Approaches

_**Challenges, risks and solution approaches**_

1. **Technological challenges**

* **FCAS and defence technology**: Development risks in complex technologies such as drone and AI systems; delays in certification and integration compared with established foreign systems (for example F-35).
  * **Solution approach: Establish a European innovation cluster with targeted research funding and cooperation between industry and research centres.**
* **Hydrogen-based steel production**: Infrastructure challenges in building hydrogen networks and scaling production technology up to industrial level.
  * **Solution approach: Build European pilot projects and model regions for scaling, combined with targeted infrastructure funding.**

2. **Economic risks**

* **Transition risks**: Short-term increases in costs and competitive disadvantages for European companies during the switch to domestic production.
  * **Solution approach: Temporary support instruments, tax incentives and risk-management programmes to relieve affected companies.**
* **Production bottlenecks**: Temporary supply-chain and production bottlenecks due to the rapid scaling up of new production capacities.
  * **Solution approach: Build strategic stockpiles and flexible production capacities to bridge critical transition phases.**
* **Market reactions**: Potential market reactions and price volatility, especially in the first phases of the transition.
  * **Solution approach: Early market communication and risk-management strategies to dampen price volatility.**

3. **Social and political challenges**

* **Industrial restructuring**: Necessary transformation of existing sectors and loss of traditional jobs in certain regions, which could trigger social tensions.
  * **Solution approach: Regional transformation funds and reskilling programmes, accompanied by structured regional development plans.**
* **Societal acceptance**: Need for intensive communication and participatory measures to secure societal consent and support.
  * **Solution approach: Stronger involvement of civil society via participatory platforms (for example CIVITAS), transparent decision-making processes and continuous information campaigns.**
