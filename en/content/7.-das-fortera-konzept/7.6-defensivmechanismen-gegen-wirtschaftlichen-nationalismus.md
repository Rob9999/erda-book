# 7.6 Defensive Mechanisms against Economic Nationalism

_**Defensive instruments against economic coercion**_

* **European Trade Defence Mechanism (ETDM)**:
  * Early detection of politically motivated trade measures.
  * Automated response mechanisms: ethically justified, proportionate counter-tariffs.
  * WTO-compliant safeguard strategy.
* **Multilateral cooperation within the WTO and beyond**:
  * New coalitions of democratic states against arbitrary protectionism.
  * Strengthening global rulebooks through democratic legitimacy.

> _Defence is not a break with the world – but the protection of the rules of the game._
