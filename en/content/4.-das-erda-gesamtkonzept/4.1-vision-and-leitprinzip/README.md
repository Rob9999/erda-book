# 4.1 Vision & Guiding Principle

_**Vision & Guiding Principle**_

_"The future is not what is coming – it is what we create together."_

The ERDA (European Rights-based Democratic Alliance or European Rule-of-law Democratic Alliance) begins with the aspiration for a democratic, rule-of-law future opportunity for Europe, humanity and our solar system, then grows into an alliance of willing democratic constitutional states in Europe, and later into a federation of democratic states under the rule of law with a shared constitution, AI-supported democracy, strategic autonomy, prosperity through automation and global responsibility.  
It defends freedom, justice, diversity and long‑term viability – with the inclusion of states from Europe, the North Atlantic and like‑minded democracies worldwide.
