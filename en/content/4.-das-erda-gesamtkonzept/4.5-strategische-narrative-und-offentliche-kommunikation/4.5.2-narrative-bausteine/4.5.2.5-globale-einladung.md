# 4.5.2.5 Global invitation

**Global invitation**

> "Join the alliance of constitutional democracies."
>
> An invitation to states, movements and people worldwide to become part of an ethical model for the future.
>
> Pluralist openness instead of identitarian isolation.

_Key pillars_

* _Inclusive discourse:_ Democratic renewal as an invitation to all global democracies and partnerships.
* _Transnational solidarity:_ Emphasising shared challenges and collective solutions.
* _Diversity as strength:_ Recognising cultural, political and social differences as a resource.

## 4.5.2.5.1 Introduction & core impulses

The narrative of the global invitation understands democracy not as a purely national project, but as an open invitation to co‑create a just, sustainable and secure world order. It calls on states, civil societies and individuals to assume responsibility together.

**Core impulses:**

* Communicate openness to the world: tell stories of successful multilateral cooperation.
* Set a shared agenda: formulate global goals that connect local initiatives.
* Showcase diversity: present examples of cultural diversity as sources of inspiration.
* Build bridges: emphasise dialogue formats between North‑South, East‑West and inter‑regional groups.

## 4.5.2.5.2 Deep dive & analysis

| Dimension              | Exclusive nationalism           | Narrative of the global invitation           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Reach**              | Inward‑looking                 | Worldwide networks                           |
| **Cooperation model**  | Bilateral agreements           | Multi‑stakeholder partnerships               |
| **Understanding of culture** | Assumption of homogeneity | Intercultural exchange                       |
| **Objective**          | Priority for national interests| Shared agenda for sustainability             |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practice impulse:** Launch a "Global Citizen Lab" series in which representatives from different regions develop joint scenarios.
>
> 🧠 **Concept contrast:** Rhetoric of isolation vs. open invitation – the former generates fear, the latter creates opportunities.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Symbolic politics without genuine participation can create frustration; inclusive design is crucial.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Democracy is an open celebration – every table is set for new guests."
