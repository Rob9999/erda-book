# 4.5.2.6 Narrative of co‑creation

**Narrative of co‑creation**

> Every country, every region, every citizen can contribute.
>
> Progress is not an elite project – but the collective construction of the future.

_Key pillars_

* _Participatory narrative structures:_ Citizens as co‑authors of collective narratives.
* _Transparent processes:_ Disclosing decision‑making paths fosters credibility.
* _Iterative involvement:_ Ongoing inclusion in development steps strengthens ownership.

## 4.5.2.6.1 Introduction & core impulses

The narrative of co‑creation puts the active involvement of all stakeholders centre stage. It combines democratic transparency with a sense of shared authorship and thus creates trust and identification.

**Core impulses:**

* Highlight co‑authorship: communicate that citizens help to shape narratives.
* Create process visibility: share milestones, feedback and decisions openly.
* Emphasise iteration: highlight continuous improvements and feedback.
* Integrate diversity of voices: ensure a pluralist representation of perspectives.

## 4.5.2.6.2 Deep dive & analysis

| Dimension                 | Monological communication      | Narrative of co‑creation                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**             | Linear and closed              | Cyclical and open                         |
| **Role of recipients**    | Passive                        | Active co‑authors                         |
| **Flow of information**   | One‑way                        | Bidirectional with feedback loops         |
| **Commitment**            | Low, after completion          | High, due to ongoing participation        |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practice impulse:** Run "narrative co‑design sessions" in which citizens jointly develop text modules.
>
> 🧠 **Concept contrast:** Centrally controlled campaigns vs. collective storytelling spaces – the former control, the latter connect.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Without clear facilitation, discussion processes can derail; structured frameworks are necessary.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Democratic narratives grow through joint editing like a garden that everyone plants."

## 4.5.2.6.3 Transformation & options for action

* Narrative co‑design tools: digital tools for collaborative text and story development.
* Open draft communities: platforms where drafts can be publicly commented on and further developed.
* Feedback retrospectives: regular online and offline meet‑ups for reflecting on and adapting narratives.
* Facilitation frameworks: guidelines and training for facilitators to ensure quality participation.
