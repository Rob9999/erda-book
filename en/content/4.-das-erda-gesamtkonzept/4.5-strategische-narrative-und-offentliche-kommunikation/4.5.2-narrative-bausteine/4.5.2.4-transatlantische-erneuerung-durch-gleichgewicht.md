# 4.5.2.4 Transatlantic renewal through balance

_**Transatlantic renewal through balance**_

> _France’s call for strategic autonomy is integrated, not interpreted confrontationally_\
> _Goal: new forms of equal partnership with all democracies – including overseas_

_Key pillars_

* _**Values‑based cooperation:** Emphasising shared democratic values as the foundation of the transatlantic partnership._
* _**Mutual resilience:** Balancing dependencies through fair burden‑sharing in security, the economy and technology._
* _**Dialogue instead of dominance:** Promoting equal communication channels between Europe and North America._
* _**Innovation architecture:** Jointly advancing future‑oriented projects in climate, AI and space._

### 4.5.2.4.1 Introduction & core impulses

The narrative of transatlantic renewal through balance focuses on a partnership no longer shaped by asymmetric dependencies but by mutual reinforcement. It links historical ties with a forward‑looking agenda.

**Core impulses:**

* **Value alignment:** Showcase successful cooperation in which human rights and the rule of law are central.
* **Balanced dependencies:** Visualise how Europe and North America share critical capacities without allowing dominance.
* **Reciprocal innovation:** Highlight bilateral research partnerships that drive sustainable technologies.
* **Cross‑Atlantic narratives:** Tell stories of transatlantic citizen exchanges and cultural encounters.

### 4.5.2.4.2 Deep dive & analysis

| Dimension               | One‑sided dependence            | Balanced equilibrium                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Security cooperation**| NATO burden‑sharing in doubt    | Joint concepts of strategic autonomy          |
| **Economic relations**  | US dominance in technology      | Mutual market opening and standard‑setting    |
| **Technology transfer** | One‑way technology exports      | Cooperative development projects              |
| **Cultural exchange**   | One‑way cultural exports        | Mutual education and cultural programmes      |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practice impulse:** Establish a "Transatlantic Fellows Exchange" in which young politicians and innovators complete mutual placements.
>
> 🧠 **Concept contrast:** Monological security discourses vs. dialogical resilience workshops – the former focus on deterrence, the latter on joint problem‑solving.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** If balance and reciprocity are maintained only symbolically, distance from democracy grows; authenticity must be tangible.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Transatlantic friendship is like a steering wheel – only in balance does it safely guide us into the future."

### 4.5.2.4.3 Transformation & options for action

* **Co‑leadership councils:** Establish bilateral councils on strategic issues with equal representation.
* **Dual‑use innovation hubs:** Funding programmes for joint start‑ups in key technologies.
* **Balanced trade agreements:** Design trade agreements that strengthen both sides equally.
* **Cultural co‑creation labs:** Platforms for joint media and art projects interweaving European and North American perspectives.
