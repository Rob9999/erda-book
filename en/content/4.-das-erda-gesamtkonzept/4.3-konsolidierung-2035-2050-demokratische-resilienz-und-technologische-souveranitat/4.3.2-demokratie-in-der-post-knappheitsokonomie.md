# 4.3.2 Democracy in the Post-Scarcity Economy

_**Democracy in the Post-Scarcity Economy**_

_Key pillars_

* _Public access to energy, education, mobility and digital infrastructure_
* _Automation replaces monotonous work – focus shifts to research, care and creativity_
* _New income models: conditional basic security, citizens' dividends, participation bonuses_

### 4.3.2.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

In a future society where material basic needs are largely met through automation and AI, the focus of democratic negotiation shifts from the distribution of scarce resources to questions of meaning, collective responsibility and social innovation. Democracy becomes a culture of active co-creation in which values, commons and ecological sustainability are at the centre.

**Core impulses:**

* Democratic legitimacy shifts from allocation decisions towards governance of commons and collective visions.
* Infrastructure and social services are sufficiently de-scarcified; democratic discourse focuses on quality, participation and impact.
* AI-supported scenario platforms enable continuous citizen participation and co-creative experimental spaces.
* New tensions arise between individual self-realisation and collective responsibility.

| Dimension              | Scarcity democracy                 | Post-scarcity democracy                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource allocation    | Competition for limited resources  | Participatory commons management                         |
| Focus of decisions     | Distribution and prioritisation    | Shaping use, impact and sustainability                   |
| Role of citizens       | Voter                              | Co-creator and guardian of the commons                   |
| Use of technology      | Increasing efficiency              | Enabling platforms for participation                     |

> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:**  
> Competition over scarcity ≠ cooperation in abundance – the former leads to resource conflicts, the latter to innovation networks.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:**  
> Prosperity blindness can dry out democratic arenas if social inequalities persist.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:**  
> "Democracy is no longer the struggle for the last loaf of bread, but the shaping of a feast in which everyone participates."

### 4.3.2.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* Build digital platforms for real-time participation in commons decisions.
* Introduce a "circularity index" as a democratic steering instrument to measure socio-ecological quality.
* Promote local commons initiatives as laboratories for sustainable practices.
* Legally anchor citizens' assemblies as permanent bodies for post-scarcity questions.
