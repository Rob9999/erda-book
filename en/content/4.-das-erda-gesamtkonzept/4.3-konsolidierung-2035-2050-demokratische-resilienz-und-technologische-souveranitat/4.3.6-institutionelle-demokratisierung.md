# 4.3.6 Institutional Democratisation

_**Institutional Democratisation**_

_Key pillars_

* _Strengthening CIVITAS as a bridge between citizens and institutions_
* _Transparent participatory budgets, deliberative citizens' assemblies, digital constitutional conventions_
* _Democracy training in schools, workplaces and public administration_

### 4.3.6.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

Democratic resilience is based on living institutions: they must be open, adaptive and close to the needs of citizens. Institutional democratisation aims to transform rigid bureaucracies into dynamic, participatory governance ecosystems.

**Core impulses:**

* **Transparency as a basic principle:** All decision-making processes and data access are documented openly and visualised publicly.
* **Participatory bodies:** Establish citizens' assemblies, youth fora and community boards as permanent parts of political processes.
* **Adaptive governance:** Agile legislative procedures with short iteration cycles, feedback loops and AI-supported scenario modelling.
* **Decentralised responsibility:** Strengthening municipal and regional competences through subsidiary decision powers and budget autonomy.

### 4.3.6.2 Deep Dive & Analysis

| Dimension                  | Traditional bureaucracy                  | Democratised institutions                                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decision-making processes  | Top-down, intransparent                  | Bottom-up, traceable via open-data portals                           |
| Citizen participation      | Sporadic input (public hearings)         | Continuous involvement (civic tech, citizens' assemblies)           |
| Law-making                 | Long, rigid procedures                   | Agile sprints, public review phases                                 |
| Responsibility & oversight | Centralised, limited feedback            | Shared responsibility, permanent feedback infrastructure            |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Pilot an "open government dashboard" at EU level that visualises draft laws, voting records and budget data in real time.
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Secret law-making ≠ open, collaborative norm-setting – the former divides, the latter strengthens trust and expertise.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Over-regulation of digital participation platforms can create access barriers and reduce real participation to mere tokenism.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Democracy is not a building but a living organism: institutions are its arteries through which participation flows."

### 4.3.6.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* **Open-data government:** Mandatory publication of all EU and national data under FAIR principles.
* **Citizens' assembly integration:** Regular inclusion of citizens' assemblies in law-making processes at all levels.
* **Agile public policy labs:** Set up labs where civil servants, experts and citizens jointly prototype new regulatory approaches.
* **Data trusts & ombuds offices:** Create independent data trustees and ombuds institutions for oversight and conflict resolution.

### 4.3.6.5 Interactive Elements

**✅ Checklist: Reviewing institutional democratisation**

* [ ] Are decision-making processes documented in a way that is traceable for all stakeholders?
