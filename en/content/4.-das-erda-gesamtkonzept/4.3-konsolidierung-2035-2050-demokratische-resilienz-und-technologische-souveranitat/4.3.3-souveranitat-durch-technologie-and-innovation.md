# 4.3.3 Sovereignty through Technology & Innovation

_**Sovereignty through Technology & Innovation**_

_Key pillars_

* _EU sovereignty cloud, dedicated data centres, post-quantum encryption_
* _Independence in AI training, chips and critical operating systems_
* _Innovation funds for open-source base technologies and citizen labs_

### 4.3.3.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

Europe must strengthen its technological independence and innovation capacity in order to secure its democratic resilience and economic competitiveness in a multipolar world. This is not about isolation, but about building a robust, values-based technology ecosystem.

**Core impulses:**

* **Technological autonomy** as a strategic necessity: Europe needs its own capacities in key areas (semiconductors, quantum computing, AI).
* **Public–private partnerships:** Close cooperation between EU institutions, national governments, research institutions and industry.
* **Open innovation** and **open source:** Openness as a lever for speed and security in development processes.
* **Values-based regulation:** Ethical guard rails ("AI basic law") foster trust and market access.

| Aspect                                 | Status quo                                       | Strategy for sovereignty                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Production capacity                    | High dependence on US/Asian suppliers            | EU Chips Act & expansion of regional manufacturing clusters        |
| Research funding                       | Fragmented programmes                             | Horizon Europe+: focus areas on quantum, biotech, AI               |
| Innovation ecosystem                   | Limited scaling of local start-ups               | European innovation agency for scaling and financing               |
| Open source & data sharing             | Protectionist tendencies                          | Openness requirements in funding criteria and standardisation      |
| Ethical & legal frameworks             | Non-uniform AI rules                              | EU AI Act and complementary "democracy audits" of algorithms      |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Under Horizon Europe 2030, pilot projects should be funded in all core regions (e.g. Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe) to anchor decentralised manufacturing and R&D.
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Pure subsidisation vs systemic ecosystem development – the latter anchors sustainable innovation dynamics.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** If the strategy remains nationally fragmented, Europe will fall into bidding wars and lose influence in the long term.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Technological sovereignty is not a bulwark – it is a network of living innovation streams."

### 4.3.3.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* **European manufacturing offensive:** Increase EU production of semiconductors by 30% by 2030 (expansion of the EU Chips Act).
* **"EIA" innovation agency:** Found a European Innovation Agency that channels funding and mentoring programmes and is closely interlinked with EDA, ERDA and CIVITAS.
* **Open-source mandate:** All publicly funded AI projects must publish their code and datasets under an open-source licence.
* **AI basic law:** Establish an independent ethics council ("AI Council") responsible for audits, certification and stress-testing of algorithms.
