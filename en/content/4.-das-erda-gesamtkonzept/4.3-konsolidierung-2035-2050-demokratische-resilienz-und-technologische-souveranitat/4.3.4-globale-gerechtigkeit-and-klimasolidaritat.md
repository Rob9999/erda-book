# 4.3.4 Global Justice & Climate Solidarity

_**Global Justice & Climate Solidarity**_

_Key pillars_

* _Building democratic resource partnerships (e.g. Chile, Namibia, Indonesia)_
* _Technology transfer programmes with fair licensing models_
* _Resilient supply chains respecting labour rights and ecological standards_
* _Democratic governance of the Arctic is understood as a test case for ecological justice and partnership with Indigenous peoples._

### 4.3.4.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

Global justice and climate solidarity are central challenges beyond Europe's borders: democracy means responsibility – towards the most vulnerable communities as well as towards future generations. This dimension extends democratic resilience through global cooperation, ecological ethics and intergenerational solidarity.

**Core impulses:**

* **Transnational responsibility:** Climate action is not a purely national project – democracies must structurally and permanently anchor solidarity with vulnerable states.
* **Finance & technology:** Fair access to climate finance (e.g. Green Climate Fund) and technology transfer are democratic imperatives.
* **Global participation:** Citizens', youth and Indigenous fora in real time connect local voices to international decision-making processes.
* **Climate justice as a human right:** Ecological sustainability belongs in a charter of universal rights – implemented under democratic control and with a people-centred approach.

### 4.3.4.2 Deep Dive & Analysis

| Dimension                        | Status quo                                                  | Democratic climate solidarity                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Financing models**            | Climate funds underfunded, contributions unevenly shared    | Participatory European Climate Solidarity Mechanism with contributions according to capacity     |
| **Technology transfer**         | Patent protection and monopolies block access               | Open-source ClimateTech framework and patent pool for global sustainability solutions            |
| **Global participation**        | Negotiation formats dominated by powerful states            | Global citizens' assemblies and youth fora with direct voting via the CIVITAS platform           |
| **Sovereignty vs solidarity**   | National go-it-alone strategies foster protectionism        | Co-creative climate alliances with local implementation and global standard-setting              |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Establish a transnational "Climate Solidarity Lab" in three partner cities – with digital reporting, citizens' assemblies and a social impact index.
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** National climate egoism vs global solidarity – the former limits future viability, the latter strengthens sustainable peace.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Fragmented financing streams and non-transparent use of funds undermine trust and endanger democratic legitimacy.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Climate is the breath of the Earth – democratic solidarity the lungs that clean and renew it."

### 4.3.4.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* **European Climate Solidarity Mechanism (ECSM):** Build a democratically legitimised climate solidarity fund with transparent allocation procedures and continuous accompaniment by citizens' assemblies via CIVITAS.
* **Global Climate Justice Assembly:** Institutionalise a multilateral citizens' assembly at UNFCCC level with regional satellites and digital consultation modules.
* **Open-source patent pool:** Provide freely accessible climate technologies on a Creative Commons basis for states and civil-society actors worldwide.
* **Debt moratorium & sustainability agenda:** Automatic debt relief for climate-vulnerable states, linked to sustainability goals negotiated democratically.
