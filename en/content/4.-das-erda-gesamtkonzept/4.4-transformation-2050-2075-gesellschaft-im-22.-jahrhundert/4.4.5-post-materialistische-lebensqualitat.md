# 4.4.5 Post‑materialist quality of life

_**Post‑materialist quality of life**_

_Key pillars_

* _Prosperity defined by communal well‑being, environmental and time sovereignty rather than consumption_
* _Purpose‑oriented work and engagement as the core of personal fulfilment_
* _Cultural, social and ecological values as drivers of sustainable happiness_

### 4.4.5.1 Introduction & core impulses

In the 22nd century, the question is no longer: "How much do we have?" but: "How well do we live?" Post‑materialist societies prioritise self‑realisation, compassion and sustainability. Values beyond possession become the foundation of resilience and democratic participation.

**Core impulses:**

* **Meaning instead of possessions:** Joint projects, creativity and volunteering increase life satisfaction.
* **Promote time prosperity:** Reduced working hours and flexible rhythms enable personal development.
* **Strengthen the common‑good economy:** Solidarity‑based economies and FORTERA initiatives link production and sustainability.
* **Cultural resonance spaces:** Collective ritual and cultural formats (SPACE festivals, CIVITAS debates) foster connectedness.

### 4.4.5.2 Deep dive & analysis

| Dimension            | Traditional growth paradigm             | Post‑materialist perspective                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Motivation           | Maximisation of material goods           | Search for meaning, relationships and sustainability      |
| Use of time          | Dominated by paid work                   | Time prosperity, education, culture and phases of care    |
| Measuring success    | Quantitative indicators (GDP, consumption)| Quality of life, common‑good index                        |
| Economic role        | Competition, profit maximisation         | Co‑creation, commons management (CIVITAS models)          |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practice impulse:** Establish "time banks" and cultural pools in municipalities where time is used as currency for neighbourhood help and social projects.
>
> 🧠 **Concept contrast:** Growth fixation ≠ focus on quality of life – more possessions do not necessarily correlate with more happiness.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Unrestrained consumption destroys environmental and social capital and undermines long‑term resilience.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Happiness is not a mountain we climb, but a garden we cultivate together."

### 4.4.5.3 Transformation & options for action

* **Time prosperity act:** Introduce an EU‑wide model of fair working‑time quotas with life‑phase‑oriented flexibility.
* **Common‑good balances:** Mandatory reports for companies and municipalities that measure ecological, social and cultural contributions (CIVITAS value indicators).
* **Cultural commons:** Expansion of free spaces (artist residencies, maker spaces) as part of the SPACE infrastructure.
* **Academies of meaning:** The ERDA Academy teaches post‑materialist competences: ethics, mindfulness, narrative design.
