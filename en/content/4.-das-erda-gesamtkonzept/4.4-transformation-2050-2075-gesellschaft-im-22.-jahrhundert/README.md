### 📘 Executive Summary for Decision-Makers

**Title of this section:**  
_"Transformation: 2050–2075 – Society in the 22nd Century (Chapters 4.4.1 – 4.4.6)"_

***

#### 🎯 Aim of this chapter

This chapter sketches the long-term development of Europe towards a democratic high-technology civilisation. It formulates key guiding visions for a common-good-oriented, meaningful and culturally diverse way of living together beyond materialist growth logic – supported by digital participation, technological responsibility and post-scarcity economic sovereignty.

#### 🧭 Core messages for decision-makers

* **Democracy is not only a form of government – but a form of conscious coexistence.**  
  The ERDA promotes collective capacity for shaping, not only administration. Co-determination becomes a way of life.
* **Post-scarcity is possible – if technology is used for the common good.**  
  Automation, AI and spaceflight serve not profit, but liberation from existential pressure.
* **Dignity replaces growth as the leading metric.**  
  Mental well-being, cultural resonance and the quality of human relationships move to the centre of political objectives.
* **Europe's global role is founded on the rule of law, justice and cooperative leadership.**  
  The ERDA becomes a civilisational model for democratic global governance – on Earth and in space.

***

#### 🛠 Recommended policy measures

* **Prepare now (from 2035):**  
  Develop new indicators for prosperity beyond GDP (e.g. resilience, diversity of education, quality of life).
* **Medium term (2050–2060):**  
  Institutionalise planetary ethics commissions, orbital fundamental rights and democratic AI governance.
* **Long term (by 2075):**  
  Fully establish post-material basic provision, universal participation and global commons models.  
  Integrate the SOLAR ALLIANCE as a civilisational counterpart to the ERDA in outer space.

#### ⚠️ Risks of inaction

Remaining in the status quo would mean that technological upheavals are steered in an authoritarian way – with increasing social alienation, loss of meaning and global injustice. Europe would lose its cultural leadership and internal coherence.

***

#### 🌍 Visionary benefits

The ERDA can become the first real-world model of a democratic and meaningful high civilisation – inclusive, peaceful, technologically advanced and culturally diverse. It opens up a new path of development for humanity in the 22nd century: not as utopia, but as realisable responsibility.
