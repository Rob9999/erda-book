### 📘 Executive Summary for Decision-Makers

**Title of this section:**  
_“Reform Phase: 2025–2035 – Strategic Reorientation of the EU (Sections 2.1–2.5)”_

***

#### 🎯 Purpose of this Chapter

This chapter outlines the central transformation phase of the EU towards a capable, sovereign and democratically resilient union – as the foundation for the later ERDA structure. It presents concrete institutional, security‑policy and societal reform paths to safeguard Europe’s political relevance, strategic autonomy and democratic capacity for innovation in a changing global environment.

#### 🧭 Key Messages for Decision-Makers

* **Democratic resilience begins with capacity to reform.**  
  The EU must strengthen core decision‑making competences in order to counter authoritarian influences and global crises effectively.
* **EVA/EDA as Europe’s second security axis.**  
  With the European Defence Alliance, a strategically autonomous, democratically controlled complement to NATO emerges – particularly for the Arctic, cyber and hybrid threats.
* **“Concentric circles” as an integrative model.**  
  The new enlargement strategy is based on commitment to values, democratic stability and functional partnership instead of mere geographic proximity.
* **Civil society as co‑creator.**  
  Through digital platforms such as CIVITAS and new participation formats, citizen participation is systematically strengthened and expanded transnationally.
* **Global democracies as strategic partners.**  
  Democratic states in Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania are not only invited but actively integrated into security and innovation partnerships.

#### 🛠 Recommended Policy Measures

* **Immediate (2025–2027):**  
  Introduce qualified majority voting in key EU areas (foreign, security, tax and social policy).  
  Build a civil‑society support structure (CIVITAS pilot projects, youth parliaments).
* **Medium term (by 2030):**  
  Institutional launch of EVA/EDA with an Article‑5 equivalent and the development of regional defence nodes (e.g. North Sea/Arctic).  
  Anchor a joint rule‑of‑law review with automatic sanctions.
* **Long term (by 2035):**  
  Full integration of selected partner states following constitutional alignment (e.g. Ukraine, Iceland, Western Balkans).  
  Build global democracy networks in the sense of strategic co‑sovereignty.

#### ⚠️ Risks of Inaction

Remaining in the status quo carries substantial risks: geopolitical marginalisation, internal fragmentation, structural inability to reform and the growing influence of authoritarian actors – inside and outside Europe. The EU risks becoming merely a stage, rather than remaining an actor.

***

#### 🌍 Visionary Benefits

The reform phase 2025–2035 lays the foundation for a vibrant, learning European alliance of democracies. It combines rule of law, strategic autonomy and civil‑society participation into a new model of global leadership through legitimacy. Europe becomes a resonance space for future, security and dignity.
