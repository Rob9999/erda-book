# 4.2.1 Implementing Key Reform Recommendations (Based on “Sailing on High Seas”)

_**Implementing Key Reform Recommendations (Based on “Sailing on High Seas”)**_

Introduction of qualified majority voting in key areas: foreign policy, security, taxation and social policy.  
Reduction in size and increase in efficiency of the European Commission.  
Strengthening of the European Parliament vis‑à‑vis the executive and the Council.  
Enforcement of the rule of law through automatic, depoliticised sanction mechanisms.

### 4.2.1.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

The study “Sailing on High Seas” proposes a six‑point plan to modernise European governance and infrastructure structures. During the reform phase 2025–2030, the task is to turn this vision into reality through concrete political processes.

**Core impulses:**

* **Establish reform dialogue** at EU and national level to align priorities.
* **Convene a European citizens’ convention** as a participatory steering instrument.
* **Mobilise a strategic investment fund** for digital and green infrastructure.
* **Adapt the legal framework:** harmonise procedures and standards across all member states.

### 4.2.1.2 Deepening & Analysis

| Area                    | Status quo                             | Need for reform                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Governance processes    | Fragmented decision‑making pathways    | Central EU steering body with a mandate for fast‑track procedures     |
| Citizen participation   | Occasional online consultations        | Permanent participation platform (CIVITAS integration layer)          |
| Financing architecture  | National funds, limited coordination   | Establishment of a pan‑European impact fund                           |
| Legal harmonisation     | Heterogeneous approval procedures      | EU‑wide procedural standards and acceleration directives              |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practice impulse:** Set up “reform offices” in every member state that report daily progress to a central EU portal.  
> 🧠 **Concept contrast:** Top‑down steering ≠ participatory transformation – both elements must be interlinked.  
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Without clear mandates and timelines, reform proposals risk dissolving into bureaucratic endless loops.  
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** “Europe as a great ship: only with a united crew and a clear course can we navigate safely through stormy seas.”

### 4.2.1.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* **Set up reform‑dialogue infrastructure:** digital and in‑person workshops in all capitals.
* **Constitute a citizens’ convention:** selection by lot, mandate for six months.
* **Structure the impact fund:** the European Commission awards seed grants for pilot projects in smart cities and network infrastructure.
* **Reform procedural law:** introduce fast‑track directives for strategically important projects.

### 4.2.1.4 Target-Group-Specific Perspectives

| Target group                 | Focus                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏛️ Decision‑makers          | Establishment of a “reform coordination council” with clearly defined roles   |
| 📚 Researchers               | Evaluation of reform‑dialogue formats and impact analyses                     |
| 🧍 Citizens                  | Participation in the citizens’ convention and feedback via the CIVITAS platform |
| 🎓 Students                  | Involvement in reform workshops as practice projects and course work          |
| 🤖 Artificial intelligences  | Development of intelligent moderation and analysis agents for citizen projects |
| 🕊️ Souls                    | Narrative storytelling: “Every voice is an oar that helps move Europe forward.” |
