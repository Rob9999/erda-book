# 4.2.2 Building the European Defence Alliance (EDA 2.0)

_**Building the Operationally and Strategically Capable European Defence Alliance (EDA 2.0)**_

> _“The European Defence Agency (EDA) [1] must reinvent itself today as a European Defence Alliance (EDA 2.0) [2]: it is to emerge as a voluntary, strategically autonomous defence community – including EU member states, the United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Ukraine and, in perspective, further democratic partners.”_

_Transformation into the European Defence Alliance (EDA 2.0)_

* _NATO‑compatible, but strategically and operationally autonomous_
* _Members: EU states (voluntary), United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Ukraine – in the medium term also open to Japan, Australia and South Korea_
* _Introduction of an Article‑5 equivalent (automatic mutual‑assistance obligation)_
* _Joint intelligence, cyber defence and critical‑infrastructure projects_
* _Dedicated budget, integrated command structure that is not, or only with great difficulty, attackable and has a rapid decision‑making mode: democratic, but not easily blocked_
* _Not fully sabotagable, as divided into independent DSN nodes_
* _Focus on resilience in the Arctic–Atlantic corridor (Iceland, Greenland, North Sea/North Atlantic)_

> _“A particular focus is on developing a DSN North Sea/North Atlantic node to protect Arctic sea routes and critical infrastructure – in cooperation with Iceland, Norway, Greenland and Canada (see the ARKTIS concept [3]).”_

_**In what follows, EDA 2.0 is referred to briefly as EVA/EDA (European Defence Alliance).**_

### 4.2.2.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

Today’s EDA is primarily a coordination forum and advisory body without an operational mandate. EVA/EDA is intended to close this gap and function as a real alliance under EU law.

**Core impulses:**

* **Extension of the mandate:** anchor a united security and defence mandate in an EVA/EDA convention.
* **Qualified majority voting:** replace unanimity with qualified‑majority decisions in strategic questions.
* **Joint budget:** establish an independent EVA/EDA budget for exercises, research and procurement.
* **Integrated command:** build an EU operations headquarters for civilian and military missions.

### 4.2.2.2 Deepening & Analysis

| Area                    | Status quo                                        | Need for reform                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mandate & legal basis   | Intergovernmental, no own mandate for deployments | Treaty‑based EVA/EDA convention with a binding mandate                          |
| Decision‑making         | Unanimity in the Council                          | Qualified‑majority procedures for taking decisions                              |
| Budget & financing      | Contributions according to GNP, no joint spending | Separate EVA/EDA budget, percentage contributions from all member states        |
| Command structure       | No EU operations HQ                               | Establish a permanent EU operations headquarters                                |
| Procurement & armaments | Parallel national programmes, duplication         | Joint procurement agency (EPA) for standardisation and economies of scale      |
| Rapid‑reaction force    | EU Battlegroups (ad hoc, limited)                 | Permanent rapid‑reaction force under EVA/EDA command                            |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practice impulse:** In the founding phase, define pilot deployments (e.g. cyber exercises) under the leadership of the new operations headquarters.  
> 🧠 **Concept contrast:** Intergovernmental coordination ≠ supranational alliance – only the latter creates real capacity to act.  
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Unclear responsibilities lead to delays and political deadlock.  
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** “EVA/EDA is the secure hub of a continent, repelling threats and transporting solidarity.”

### 4.2.2.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* **Convene an EVA/EDA convention:** negotiate a founding convention of all member states by the end of 2026.
* **Anchor majority procedures:** include QMV in an amendment to the EU treaties (Art. xxx TFEU).
* **Set up an EVA/EDA budget:** propose 1% of EU GDP as the base‑year budget.
* **Install an operations HQ:** convert the EDA premises in Brussels into an EU operations centre.
* **Create a joint procurement agency:** establish an EPA mandated for tanks, drones and cyber‑technology.
* **Define standby forces:** rotating contingents of 5,000 troops for immediate deployments.
