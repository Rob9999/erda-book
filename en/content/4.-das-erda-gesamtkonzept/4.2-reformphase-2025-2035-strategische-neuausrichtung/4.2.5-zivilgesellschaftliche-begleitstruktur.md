# 4.2.5 Civil Society Accompanying Structure

_**Civil Society Accompanying Structure**_

_**Participation, transparency and feedback as the foundation of democratic reforms**_

> _"A strong civil society is the pulse of a living democracy – only those who listen can shape sustainably."_

_The ERDA establishes an independent, multi-layer civil society accompanying structure to underpin reform processes with expertise, legitimacy and broad societal anchoring._

_Civil society accompanying structure:_

* _Supporting a pan-European culture of participation through platforms such as CIVITAS._
* _Piloting transnational citizens' assemblies and youth parliaments to accompany the reform process._
* _Upgrading civil society expertise in EU institutions (e.g. advisory chambers)._ 

### 4.2.5.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

The inclusion of civil society actors ensures that reforms do not bypass people's needs but are co-shaped from the bottom up:

**Core impulses:**

* **Multi-stakeholder councils**: Establishment of thematic advisory boards (youth, environment, culture, economy, digital rights).
* **Regular consultations**: Half-yearly fora at EU, national and local level.
* **Digital feedback platform**: Permanent online dialogue with transparent moderation and reporting mechanisms.

### 4.2.5.2 Deep Dive & Analysis

| Area                      | Status quo                               | Need for reform                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Participation formats     | Ad hoc citizens' assemblies, irregular dialogues | Regular, institutionalised multi-stakeholder conferences               |
| Transparency & reporting  | Fragmented information flows             | Central monitoring dashboard with open-data interfaces                      |
| Funding                   | Project-based EU funding                 | Permanent civil society budget (0.1% of the EU budget)                      |
| Capacity building         | Local initiatives without EU integration | EU-wide networked "democracy labs" with method training and coaching       |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Pilot "democracy labs" in three regions where citizens and NGOs co-design concrete legislative proposals.
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Episodic consultation ≠ continuous dialogue – only the latter guarantees learning and adaptation cycles.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Without a clear reporting structure, feedback dissipates in administrative silos.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Civil society is the living root system that nourishes and stabilises reforms."

### 4.2.5.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* **Establish a Civil Society Council** (2026): Consolidation of all thematic advisory boards under a European umbrella.
* **Introduce EU dialogue fora** (from 2025): Half-yearly conferences with a fixed agenda and review mandate.
* **Set up an online participation hub** (2025): Platform with feedback widgets, comment functions and transparent tracking.
* **Expand the democracy-lab network** (2027): Method training and peer coaching for local actors.
* **Secure permanent funding** (2026): Establishment of an "ERDA Civil Society Fund" for long-term projects.
