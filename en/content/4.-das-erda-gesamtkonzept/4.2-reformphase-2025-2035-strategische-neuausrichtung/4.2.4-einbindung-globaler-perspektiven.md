# 4.2.4 Integrating Global Perspectives

_**Integrating Global Perspectives**_

_**Global cooperation as a lever for democratic resilience and innovation**_

> _"Only those who invite the world into their democratic arenas can respond to global challenges jointly and in line with shared values."_

_The ERDA systematically opens up to strategic partnerships beyond Europe – in politics, security, the economy and culture._

_Integrating global perspectives_

* _Expanding partnership-based relations with democracies in the Global South._
* _Cooperation with regional organisations for the rule of law and climate justice._
* _Building fair raw-material and technology alliances with mutual added value._

### 4.2.4.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

The global networking of democratic states increases ERDA's clout and fosters cooperation on innovation and security:

**Core impulses:**

* **Global frameworks**: Expanding multilateral fora (e.g. "ERDA Global Forum") for norm-setting and standardisation.
* **Strategic partnerships**: Sectoral agreements in technology (FORTERA), security (EDA), digital democracy (CIVITAS).
* **Exporting values**: Joint codes on rule of law, human rights and AI ethics.

### 4.2.4.2 Deep Dive & Analysis

| Field of cooperation      | Status quo                                    | Need for reform                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security & defence        | Bilateral EDA partnerships with Canada/USA    | Multilateral security dialogues with Asia-Pacific democracies                      |
| Technology & innovation   | FORTERA focus on Europe                       | Global R&D alliances (quantum, AI), knowledge-sharing hubs                         |
| Digital democracy         | CIVITAS projects within the EU                | Open-source civic-tech initiatives with global democracies                         |
| Climate & resources       | ARKTIS cooperation with Canada                | Expansion to the Southern Hemisphere (Chile, Costa Rica) for climate partnerships  |
| Culture & education       | Erasmus+, Creative Europe                     | "ERDA Global Fellows" programme with exchanges for government and civil society   |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Launch a "Global Civic Hackathon" in 2026 with participants from Europe, North America, Asia and Latin America – to co-develop digital participation tools.
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Regional island solutions ≠ globally integrated standards – only the latter create scale effects and trust.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Exclusive alliances can fuel mistrust – open, transparent processes are essential.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Global partnerships are the network that stabilises the democratic tree against any storm."

### 4.2.4.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* **Establish an ERDA Global Forum** (2027): Annual meeting with associated democracies to derive joint action plans.
* **Launch a multilateral technology platform** (2026): Joint development centres for AI ethics, quantum research and green tech.
* **CIVITAS Global rollout** (2028): Pilot projects for digital citizen participation in partner countries (e.g. Canada, Japan).
* **Extended EDA partnership** (2025–2030): Inclusion of Asia-Pacific democracies in modular security exercises.
* **Climate Solidarity Pact** (2026): Binding agreements with South American states on resource security and emissions reduction.
