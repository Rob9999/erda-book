# 4.2.3 Enlargement Strategy Based on the Model of “Concentric Circles”

_**Enlargement Strategy Based on the Model of “Concentric Circles”**_

_**Gradual integration and partnership in three concentric circles**_

> _“The model of concentric circles enables a flexible, values‑based enlargement of ERDA: from core members with deep constitutional anchoring, via associated partners, through to global democracies – each circle has its own rights, obligations and participation formats.”_

_Enlargement strategy based on the model of “concentric circles”_

* _Core ERDA: democracies firmly grounded in the rule of law with constitutional anchoring._
* _Extended partnership: states with an EU perspective or close association (e.g. UK, Western Balkans, Mediterranean region)._ 
* _Global associates: democracies such as Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Costa Rica, Chile – without political integration, but with security and innovation linkages._

> _Conclusion: ERDA enlargement deliberately does not follow rigid accession patterns, but is guided by a flexible model of concentric circles._

### 4.2.3.1 Introduction & Core Impulses

The enlargement of the European Rights‑Based Democratic Alliance (ERDA) does not follow a rigid accession procedure but a differentiated model of concentric circles.

**Core impulses:**

* **Core ERDA:** fully integrated states with constitutional binding.
* **Extended partnership:** democracies with partial integration – politically, in security and in economic affairs.
* **Global associates:** partner states outside Europe that conclude strategic alliances.

### 4.2.3.2 Deepening & Analysis

| Circle                     | Description                                       | Conditions                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔵 Core ERDA               | Full membership under the ERDA constitution      | Constitutional anchoring, rule of law, ODA       |
| 🟡 Extended partnership    | Partial integration in politics, EVA/EDA, CIVITAS, FORTERA | Democracy index ≥ 7, financial contributions, reforms |
| 🟢 Global associates       | Security and innovation cooperation              | Shared values, sectoral agreements                |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practice impulse:** Launch bilateral dialogue forums with two pilot states in the extended circle – for example Norway and Switzerland – to test associative rights and obligations.  
> 🧠 **Concept contrast:** One‑size‑fits‑all accession ≠ gradual integration – only differentiated circles preserve coherence and attractiveness.  
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Hasty accessions without institutional preparation weaken core ERDA and undermine trust.  
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** “The concentric circles are the rings of a strong tree: each carries and protects the centre.”

### 4.2.3.3 Transformation & Options for Action

* **Consolidate the core circle:** adopt an ERDA constitutional amendment by 2028 for existing full members.
* **Partnership agreements:** model agreement and timeline for extended partners (2026–2030).
* **Global cooperation platform:** establish an “ERDA Global Forum” for associated democracies from 2027 onwards.
* **Transition modalities:** stagger rights (CIVITAS co‑determination, EVA/EDA participation, FORTERA access).
* **Monitoring & review:** annual peer reviews of partners based on joint criteria.

### 4.2.3.4 Target-Group-Specific Perspectives

| Target group                 | Focus                                                                                 |
