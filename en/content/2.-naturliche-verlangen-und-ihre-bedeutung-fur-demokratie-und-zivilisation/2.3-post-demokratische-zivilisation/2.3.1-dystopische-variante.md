# 2.3.1 Dystopian variant

_**Dystopian variant**_

_(technocracy, AI autocracy)_

| Natural desire          | Distortion through technocratic oversteering            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Survival**            | Security state, permanent surveillance                   |
| **Reproduction**        | Control over reproduction, socialisation by system logic |
| **Learning/adaptation** | Censorship, algorithm-driven manipulation                |
| **Connection**          | Sham cooperation, instrumental relationships             |
| **Expression/creation** | Filtered creativity – only system-conform                |
| **Harmony**             | Enforced conformity instead of genuine balance           |

_Conclusion_: Civilisation lives – **but under external control**. It has handed over its thinking to the system. Autopoietic, but soulless.

### 2.3.1.1 Introduction and core impulses

In the dystopian variant, civilisation is controlled from outside by technocratic orthopraxy and automated control. Natural desires are systematically overridden and forced into rigid functional logics.

**Core impulses:**

- **Surveillance society:** Security through permanent data collection instead of the rule of law.
- **Reproductive control:** Demographic planning as an algorithm instead of freedom.
- **Manipulated learning:** Education and knowledge centrally filtered by AI systems.
- **Instrumental connections:** Relationships as networks of control and efficiency.
- **Censored freedom of expression:** Creativity only permitted if system-conform.
- **Enforced harmony:** Conformity as the ideal, deviation as a risk.

### 2.3.1.2 Deep dive and analysis

| Natural desire   | Distortion through dystopian technocracy                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Survival**     | Total surveillance, algorithm-based risk assessment      |
| **Reproduction** | Prescribed reproduction quotas, genetic selection        |
| **Learning**     | Curricula defined by AI evaluation, knowledge filtering  |
| **Connection**   | Network chips, instrumental interaction                  |
| **Expression**   | Censored creativity engines, real-time content moderation |
| **Harmony**      | Social credit scores, sanctions for deviants            |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse (Antikythera):** Create transparency registers for algorithms and AI decision trees – including an audit charter. [4]
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Free autonomy ≠ optimised control – autonomy is a precondition for innovation.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Technical efficiency can become the enemy of democratic resilience.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "A society without error loses its potential for vitality."

### 2.3.1.3 Transformation and courses of action

- **Ethics code for AI:** Internationally binding rules to preserve human autonomy.
- **AI audit bodies:** Independent commissions review algorithms for discrimination and transparency.
- **Data ownership rights:** Citizens gain full control over their personal data.
- **Open-source initiatives:** Free AI frameworks as alternatives to proprietary control systems.
- **Spaces for reflection:** Public forums for debates on technological boundaries.
