# 2. Natural Desires and Their Significance for Democracy and Civilisation

_**Natural desires and their projection onto civilisations – a philosophical resonance space in the spirit of ERDA**_

> _"The natural desire of every living being is: to exist, to unfold, to pass on, to enter into connection – and at some point perhaps to understand why."_

These fundamental needs – survival, reproduction, learning, connection, expression, harmony – can also be applied to civilisations. They are not mere power apparatuses but social life forms with an inner dynamic. ERDA stands for a form of conscious civilisation that faces up to its evolutionary responsibility.

### 📘 **Executive Summary for Decision-Makers**

**Title of the section:**

**"Natural Desires and Their Significance for Democracy and Civilisation" (Chapter 2.1–2.4)**

***

**🎯 Purpose of this chapter**

Chapter 2 provides the **civilisational foundation** of the ERDA concept. It shows that stable, just democracies are not only institutional constructions, but rest on the **natural desires** of the human soul. These desires (meaning, security, recognition, participation, connection) are the driving energy of every future-proof society.

**🧭 Key messages for decision-makers**

1. **Civilisations do not emerge by accident – they follow an inner development path.**
   * This begins with pre-democratic forms (tribal structures, empire, nation state),
   * leads to the democratic constitutional order (present),
   * and strives – either – towards dystopian control or towards a **mature, resonant democracy**.
2. **Democracy only works if it is conceived as a response to human basic needs.**
   * These include: protection from arbitrariness, free self-realisation, spiritual home, shared experience of meaning.
3. **The greatest danger: technocratic systems without ethical depth.**
   * There, the human being is reduced to a consumer or functional carrier.
   * The consequence: frustration with democracy, radicalisation or withdrawal into the private sphere.
4. **Europe's task in the 21st century:**
   * To develop a form of democracy that is not only an institution, but remains a **resonance space for what is human**.
   * This form is based on education, ethics, openness – and on a deep understanding of the "why".

***

**🛠 Recommended policy measures (2025–2035)**

* **Strengthen democracy education** – not only as the transfer of knowledge, but as the creation of experience and meaning (in schools, media, civil-society spaces)
* **Charge constitutional values emotionally** through narratives that create identity and belonging (for example through culture, language, shared rituals)
* **Bring democratic institutions into resonance** with technology, AI, environment and culture – as living systems, not as rigid administrative logic
* **Promote conscious differentiation**: Europe does not stand for arbitrariness, but for conscious plurality with ethical grounding

***

**⚠️ Risks if neglected**

* Loss of cultural and emotional attachment to democracy
* Opening for authoritarian narratives ("strong hand", "technical efficiency")
* Reduction of the human being to the role of user in digital systems
* Alienation between citizens and state

***

**🌍 Visionary benefit**

* Europe becomes the **guardian of a democratic civilisation with meaning** – visible and attractive worldwide
* The next generation does not experience democracy as a form of administration, but as a space for unfolding and shared responsibility
* Resonance-based democracies are, in the long term, more stable, more innovative and more peaceful
