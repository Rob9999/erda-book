# 2.1 Pre-democratic civilisation

_**Pre-democratic civilisation**_

_(tribal, monarchical, authoritarian – driven by instinct)_

| Natural desire | Societal projection                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Survival       | Preservation of the tribe, dynastic power, external defence |
| Reproduction   | Legitimacy through origin, bloodlines, divine order        |
| Learning       | Myth, magic, religious dogma                               |
| Connection     | Obedience, loyalty, bonds of blood                         |
| Expression     | Monuments, epics, displays of rule                         |
| Harmony        | Order through hierarchy, subjugation                       |

_Conclusion_: Civilisation functions like a survival instinct – powerful but blind. Reflection is absent.

### 2.1.1 Introduction and core impulses

In pre-democratic civilisations, tribal or monarchical structures dominated, in which natural desires were directly translated into the exercise of power and social control. Reflection and collective participation were largely confined to ritualised forms.

**Core impulses:**

- **Maximising survival:** Security was ensured through hierarchy and fear.
- **Legitimising power:** Bloodlines and divine order determined who ruled.
- **Communal attachment:** Belonging was based on tribal affiliation and loyalty.
- **Ritualised order:** Decisions were taken within ceremonial displays of power.

### 2.1.2 Deep dive and analysis

| Natural desire   | Societal projection                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Survival**     | Tribal alliances, conscription, centralised control |
| **Reproduction** | Dynastic marriages, inheritance systems, claims to legitimacy |
| **Learning**     | Myths, religious dogma, esoteric elite knowledge  |
| **Connection**   | Bonds of blood, patron–client relationships       |
| **Expression**   | Monumental architecture, displays of rule         |
| **Harmony**      | Subjugation, sanctions, social deterrence         |

> 🎛️ **Boxes:**
>
> 📌 **Practical impulse:** Small communities can learn from tribal councils: rotation principles and rotating spokesperson roles strengthen participatory inclusion. [4]
>
> 🧠 **Conceptual contrast:** Instinct-driven rule vs. conscious self-limitation – without spaces for reflection, society remains dysfunctional.
>
> ⚠️ **Risk:** Transferring authoritarian patterns to modern systems fuels disillusionment with democracy.
>
> 🌍 **Visionary metaphor:** "Pre-democratic structures are like dams – they hold in the short term, but eventually they break."

### 2.1.3 Transformation and courses of action

- **Ritualised deliberation:** Introduce regular, moderated assemblies (analogous to tribal councils) for collective opinion-forming.
- **Rotation principle:** Time-limited mandates for local office-holders to prevent concentration of power.
- **Reflecting myths:** Use shared narratives both to strengthen civil-society cohesion and to create critical distance.
- **Integrative education:** Teach historical forms of rule as a subject of democratic reflection.
