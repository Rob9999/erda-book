# gitbook-worker

To install the helper utilities run:

```bash
pip install .
```

You can then call `gitbook-worker` to process a GitBook repository.

## Upgrade notes

Version 2.0.0 of the `gitbook-worker` package consolidates the helper scripts into
an installable module. The command line interface remains compatible, but you
should reinstall the package to get the latest improvements:

```bash
pip install -U gitbook-worker
```
