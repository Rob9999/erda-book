# Tools

This folder contains helper utilities for working with the ERDA book repository.

## Legacy status

The Python package in `gitbook-worker/` is considered legacy; its remaining features are scheduled to migrate into the `.github/tools` workflow suite so GitHub Actions no longer needs to install this project. See `../docs/tooling_migration_plan.md` for the review and migration proposal.【F:docs/tooling_migration_plan.md†L1-L47】
