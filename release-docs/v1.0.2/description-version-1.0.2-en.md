Version 1.0.2 of the ERDA book fixes ordering issues and closes gaps in the English edition. Chapter 3 now sits correctly between Chapters 2 and 4, the missing Section 3.7 is translated and included, and the Appendix J heading is cleaned up. The release documentation now also includes an English short description. The book’s thematic focus remains the same: a strategy for Europe’s democratic renewal grounded in human needs, resonance, and resilience. Licence and metadata matrix remain unchanged (texts CC BY-SA 4.0, code MIT, fonts dual CC BY 4.0/MIT, emojis Twemoji CC BY 4.0).
